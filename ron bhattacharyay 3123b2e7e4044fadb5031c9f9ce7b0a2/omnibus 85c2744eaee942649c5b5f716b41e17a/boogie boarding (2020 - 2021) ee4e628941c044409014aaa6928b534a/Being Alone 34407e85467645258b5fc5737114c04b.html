INTRODUCTION</strong></p><p id="c1de82e7-bfb7-49a3-959f-f4ff5c19d202" class="">Now may be a great time to get to know yourself. Here’s why.</p><p id="814a0975-73c2-47e8-a535-2aa5c1d2b434" class="">Time has been blurring lately. As we continue to conduct our entire lives from the same few hundred square feet for more than 2 months, we begin to lose our context.</p><p id="b0507dc6-6381-4113-8168-a91cecca4ec2" class="">Context gives us a sense of purpose and reason.</p><p id="672cd9ef-9698-4631-8720-ee443bda9c6e" class="">What good is my humor if no one laughing? Why do I have so many clothes if I’m wearing the same 3 outfits every single day? What’s the point of me trying to do anything at all in a world that I can barely see, touch, or feel?</p><p id="428f7ff4-df3a-4942-a481-413e04d749f7" class="">I guess this is why we’re all on Zoom.</p><p id="868a17c5-98a3-4bed-9dff-7b8b31dd31a1" class="">Maybe if we can keep on having our happy hours—or dates, birthday celebrations, conferences—we’ll have a reason to tell our jokes, to wear a different shirt for once, to stay motivated to keep working. And maybe if we add on some things we would never imagine doing before—live video karaoke, video chat game nights, virtual weddings, book clubs!—we might experience some triumph of spirit. Something to remind us that we aren’t <em>just</em> surviving.</p><p id="850f50db-0e5f-4933-9c7d-23c27b11f35c" class="">But the context that Zoom gives us is weak. Diet context. Gluten-free context. It just doesn’t quite taste the same as, well, real life.</p><p id="12704e57-1946-4304-b01d-30756efb6cf5" class="">When you hit “Leave Meeting” and the stereo white noise from other people’s bedrooms cuts out, the quiet hits quick.</p><p id="c8860599-25db-4671-8fae-f6537a6d0aea" class="">You’re still in the same seat you’ve been in for weeks, breathing the same air, staring at the same wall. As much as you know that there’s a world out there—a world you were <em>just</em> seeing through the wizardry of high speed connection and built-in front facing cameras—the afterglow of that video context just doesn’t last.</p><p id="d874420e-95e8-44a9-b808-a78c681a83fe" class="">You’re alone, bored and ready for this shit to end. The impatience is real, and we’re all feeling it.</p><p id="8336ecfc-9005-4b53-9cae-af43c1e9ed0f" class="">That’s why we fill the moments between Zoom calls with puzzles, reading lists, new baking habits, virtual workout classes and endless social media scrolling.</p><p id="044e8057-2645-4aa2-8bc3-e7d9515c33d8" class="">But what if we didn’t <em>need</em> to fill those moments?</p><h3 id="ecb87142-aba8-4f70-9db8-6d92d76f1d3b" class="">About this essay</h3><p id="fa5262cf-7b2d-44de-bfda-6b9697f46bf4" class="">Besides this introduction, I originally delivered this as a TEDx talk for a group of high school students in February 2020, just before quarantine and our new normal.</p><p id="17a720b3-49cd-4d76-91a3-cebde3d4275b" class="">The way I thought about it was that when you grow up constantly connected, never needing to be bored at all, it’s easy to completely overlook the importance of building a relationship with yourself. But the more I pay attention to how “adults” are managing in this moment, the more I believe this message isn’t just for young people.</p><p id="eb2f95b8-ebc2-4ada-b8f0-47fdd266f054" class="">At the root of so much of our experience right now is a face-to-face encounter with loneliness. It’s why we’re scrambling for connection and cures to boredom.</p><p id="e97208ce-b8a2-45d2-b8dd-52d2e958345a" class="">There’s nothing wrong with these things, but I think there’s a deeper opportunity here that shouldn’t be missed—and that’s what this essay is about:</p><p id="1bce24b5-604b-40c6-b560-daf2c7c93705" class=""><strong>You can’t address your own experience of loneliness just by finding connection with the people around you. You need to find connection with yourself.</strong></p><p id="9bfacce6-fc6c-4e41-8f5c-bfabe1cfd314" class="">In the quiet of being alone, you have space to notice what it is that you’re feeling; to pay attention to how you are responding—not just to the global situation, but to the vacuum, the nothingness that has taken the place of your normal, day-to-day life.</p><p id="8d70f5b0-fcb6-4a2d-91e4-c5e9defd68eb" class="">When you run out of context to give yourself a sense of meaning and purpose—that is, when the Zoom calls are over and you’ve finished your puzzle—all that’s left is you, and, at some point, that has to be enough.</p><p id="172da24c-5bb3-4e07-a6a6-b07035525d71" class="">This might just be the best moment you’ve had to get to know who you actually are.</p><h3 id="55953ac6-9abe-4711-a202-1f6ebe85f41b" class="">Where are we going here?</h3><p id="32b778ac-2413-48b6-92b4-1f6b4532b114" class="">If this introduction strikes some chord for you, you might find something for yourself in this essay.

Suppose I asked you, in a group: “Who here has been lonely lately?” Many of you might think to yourselves, “Hm, yeah. I have,” but only a fraction would actually raise your hands, if any. (For what it’s worth, I’ve been feeling lonely all morning, and, no, I wouldn’t raise my hand.)</p><p id="f8616bc0-c7b1-4d67-a829-76b626f10113" class="">It’s understandable. Admitting you are lonely can feel like you’re admitting a fundamental flaw about yourself. There must be a reason you’re lonely. <em>I’m insignificant and unworthy of connection! </em> Surely, you don’t want other people to know that.</p><h3 id="478bf402-b2ce-4f6f-98b8-60e4818cd701" class="">We’re all afraid of being lonely.</h3><p id="54999331-c217-4300-a535-a7cf90f7216b" class="">It’s why we do so much of what we do. The dance that is our day-to-day lives is largely guided by our desire to feel connected to something. In a sense, we are always running away from loneliness. We’re occasionally successful.
