single idea which we will revisit again and again, what networks, complexity and inter-dependency describe are the physical features of a city:<strong> networks are spatial relationships among objects in a digital world</strong>.</p><p id="7f7e6bff-7963-42ce-b3bd-480fd54903b7" class="">In the physical world these networks of <strong>proximity</strong> create value in real estate, or any tangible asset. This proximity exists in physical things, like cities and biological organisms, where physical distance circumscribes interactions, ranging from streets to central business districts, to the collective computation of squamous cells and chemical messengers in-situ. But proximity also exists in the abstract of ideas, software, social networks, trust and pedigree.</p><p id="29ae2427-2a47-4c73-a3bf-585532b6d919" class="">Network effects and increasing returns to scale are a common feature of <strong>proximity</strong>, but historically their effects were largely local limited by the effectiveness of communications technologies. Simplified to its essence, proximity seems to describe the relationships between computation and data, through the communication of physical (light, sound, chemical, electrical) or digital (binary) information. It seems in a digital world, these features of proximity define the earnings power of any asset; the economics of real estate describes its features.</p><p id="5c1d95b4-6960-4586-bae6-3b0a421b45b0" class="">To see <strong>proximity</strong> in a digital world, we must first imagine it.</p><p id="a3f1fadf-8791-4893-a1c6-8c6d0dac9d99" class="">When you log on to the internet, you exist in an digital information space. From your original search query, network hops describe how far you’ve traveled and minutes of engagement define how long you’ve stayed.

As he explored the wonders of literature and the history of the country, the young Lincoln, already conscious of his own power, developed ambitions far beyond the expectations of his family and neighbors. It was through books that he was able to transcend his surroundings.-- “Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln”, Doris Kearns Goodwin (2005).</blockquote><p id="a8cea292-4bab-4b6a-bd90-b7bdb8e17f69" class="">This essay is about the business model of (information) platforms, like Google, Facebook and Tencent, which are some of the most dominant businesses the world has ever seen.

We can describe the four walls of a retail store as physical square footage but also the amount of time a customer spends <em>physically</em> within the GPS coordinates of its footprint; in this way location can be described in minutes of time. A store in shopping mall might define its proximity as conveniently located near an anchor tenant, Class-A office space, and within walking distance to the subway.</p><p id="af6c3040-0298-46c1-bdf9-d543ff673e4b" class="">Real estate’s highest and best use depends on <strong>specialization</strong>, or how the space is configured for customer demand and a type of monetization which maximizes revenue.

A store in the suburbs might have customer footfall of a 1,000 prospects per day with a<strong> conversion</strong> of 10% (100 people) who will become customers.
