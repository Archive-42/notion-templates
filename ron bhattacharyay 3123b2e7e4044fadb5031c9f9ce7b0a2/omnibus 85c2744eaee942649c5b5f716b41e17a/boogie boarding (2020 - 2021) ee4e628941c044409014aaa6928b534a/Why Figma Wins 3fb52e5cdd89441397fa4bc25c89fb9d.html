sequencing of loops. While it’s possible to stumble into an initial core loop that works, the companies that are successful in the long term are the ones that can repeatedly find the next loop. However, this evolution is poorly understood relative to its existential impact on a company’s trajectory. <a href="http://figma.com/">Figma</a> is a prime example of sequencing loops. They’re now widely viewed as successful, but the key factors in their success and what bets they must make to get to the next level are less widely understood.</p><figure id="00fd6dae-97e4-40d3-844e-ae24d944041a" class="image"><a href="Why%20Figma%20Wins%203fb52e5cdd89441397fa4bc25c89fb9d/fast.gif"><img style="width:700px" src="Why%20Figma%20Wins%203fb52e5cdd89441397fa4bc25c89fb9d/fast.gif"/></a></figure><p id="6db78bef-e572-48d8-976b-404a90e999d8" class="">bet you didn’t know I could make gifs</p><p id="a25300cc-e63e-462e-bb0b-03abd22486af" class="">
</p><p id="e8f88eab-6868-4815-8e69-ba4c211649ef" class="">The core insight of Figma is that design is larger than just designers. Design is all of the conversations between designers and PMs about what to build. It is the mocks and prototypes and the feedback on them. It is the handoff of specs and assets to engineers and how easy it is for them to implement them. Building for this entire process doesn’t take away the importance of designers—it gives them a seat at the table for the core decisions a company makes.
</p><p id="7515fa95-25b6-4551-a218-25b51d2c9dbb" class="">Building for everyone in the design process and not <em>just</em> designers is also the foundation of Figma’s core loop, which drives their growth and compounding scale. That network effect is made possible by Figma’s key early choices like:</p><ul id="cf105190-d94c-4e0e-8812-0a164768ce20" class="bulleted-list"><li>Architecting Figma to be truly browser-first, instead of just having storage be in the cloud</li></ul><ul id="a5e099ee-abc6-4894-960c-8ad79d9d9030" class="bulleted-list"><li>Their head start in new technologies like WebGL and CRDTs that made this browser-first approach possible</li></ul><ul id="8f28302b-3131-498a-9f1b-cbd86dd2ba22" class="bulleted-list"><li>Focusing on a product purpose built for those designing vector based digital products</li></ul><p id="38ec4bb6-c049-45e9-afe8-d6606c39c8e9" class="">
</p><p id="9ed06ee5-4525-4415-be9d-f7f8af8bcf1c" class="">Figma’s compounding growth is not only due to product market fit, but is also driven by the alignment between their product and distribution. There are limits to Figma’s success if it remains only valued and spread within companies. In order to break through that asymptote, Figma must build a global network effect across the ecosystem. Figma’s value to new users should compound as Figma’s adoption grows, even for solo users outside of organizations. Figma has begun making its bets on how it will become a platform—namely centered around communities and plugins. While it’s still early, these bets can be unpacked and understood.</p><p id="22964273-b549-4c47-979d-84ae1763180b" class="">
</p><p id="3a24405b-529f-42df-a116-ce05c1c3a6e2" class="">Many companies are now at this inflection point. They have found success with their core product and are trying to push themselves to the next level of value to customers and scale. Our understanding of building platforms and sequencing towards them is still nascent. From how to shift the allocation of resources between a company’s core business and its potential future expansions to how to structure a platform to catalyze its growth and more. Until the playbook is well understood, it is more art than science. There are many decisions to make, including which layers should be centralized, whether the ecosystem should be driven by open source contributors or profit-seeking enterprises, how broad in scope to allow the ecosystem to grow and where to not let it grow, and more.</p><p id="db3526aa-c9fc-4d40-9cd4-4677b86f653e" class="">

Engineering is one field that has exhibited significant compounding progress over time. Whether Figma’s bets in building out global network effects will be able to push this level of progress in design will be an important question to watch.</p><p id="4ddd8157-ade1-4fb7-a333-0c1869b59dc4" class="">
</p><h2 id="3b19f29e-ae78-4f98-bab8-3d8dcf9e329e" class="">The Arc of Collaboration</h2><p id="f9c8a455-9068-4885-a39c-c2bfba334725" class="">When Figma first launched, its value proposition was primarily around making design collaborative. If design could happen in the browser, then designers could work together on the same projects. In fact, they could even work on a design at the same time.</p><p id="d2923fa5-a56a-4e49-91dc-9b57320aa0cb" class="">
</p><p id="b0836fdc-faf7-4587-a8e0-88f09efb69b0" class="">In 2014 as I helped diligence Figma <em>(disclaimer: I worked on Greylock’s investment in Figma, but I don’t have a personal stake in Figma. sadly.)</em>, I used to sit with designers at startups and watch them work. The top right corner of their screens were always a nonstop cycle of Dropbox notifications. Because design teams saved all their files in a shared folder like Dropbox, every time a coworker made a revision they would get a notification. And often there were complex naming conventions to make sure that people were using the right versions.</p><p id="3d365134-f468-493b-957a-8bfca153cabb" class="">
</p><p id="c0978d03-ecd2-4344-91d2-5c4b896147e9" class="">Figma solved this problem. Designs in Figma are not just stored in the cloud; they are edited in the cloud, too. This means that Figma users are always working on the same design. With Dropbox, this isn’t true. The files may be stored in the cloud, but the editing happens locally—imagine the difference between sharing Word files in Dropbox vs. editing in Google Docs.</p><p id="2ba34bb4-43ee-47a4-96b3-a534db499682" class="">
</p><p id="b35838c3-ebee-410b-890d-448b49776852" class="">Any time a user edits a design, they are in effect checking out a temporary copy. This is why two users editing a file simultaneously creates issues. When designs are edited with Figma, there are no conflicts. And since revisions are a first party feature of each design in Figma, there’s no need to have complex files with names like “profile_design_v23_final_draft2”. Similarly, designers can comment directly in each other’s files, instead of sending emails with feedback.</p><p id="93da039a-8e30-4dc9-bc77-f7ac36f53571" class="">

</p><p id="acd9a72a-459a-4de1-86ba-d21b3f7be0e5" class="">I used to be confused by the Figma’s team consistent framing of Figma as browser-first. What was the distinction between this and cloud-first? Over time I’ve come to see how important this distinction has been. When many creative tools companies talk about the cloud, they seem to view it as an amorphous place that they store files. But the fundamental user experience of creating in their products is done via a standalone app on the desktop. Figma is browser-first, which was made possible (and more importantly performant) by their understanding and usage of new technologies like WebGL, Operational Transforms, and CRDTs.</p><p id="127d03e4-d634-4f3b-a2f1-0f014d7dd7a1" class="">
</p><p id="b8a6ad44-da77-4a74-992a-3262536cce5a" class="">From a user’s perspective, there are no files and no syncing that needs to be done with others editing a design. The actual *experience* of designing in Figma is native to the internet. Even today, competitors often talk about cloud, but are torn over how *much* of the experience to port over to the internet. Hint: “all of it” is the correct answer that they all eventually will converge on.</p><p id="e2c3f038-09bd-47d0-9448-927d37944577" class="">
</p><p id="db01f891-acc3-4e53-92bd-181314361e67" class="">Designers loved Figma and this drew initial distribution. And with features like team libraries, designers have incentive to pull in other designers on their team into Figma. But a tool designers love, while a prerequisite for success, does not fully capture the root of Figma’s traction so far. While Figma has been building the ideal tool for designers, they’ve actually built something more important: a way for non-designers to be involved in the design process.</p><p id="9d7d5557-1cb7-4b82-a299-b13910725b00" class="">

</p><p id="956014d5-c4ef-47d9-b796-0a5e98528b9e" class="">We often forget that the purpose of the tools we use at work isn’t to increase our individual productivity, but the entire team’s productivity. Companies themselves often forget this.</p><p id="d4db597e-fbec-40ed-9867-cac1c9b8c336" class="">
</p><p id="be89e7cf-34c6-4158-ac47-031166e67fdf" class="">The best tool for individuals may <em>also</em> be the best for the entire team. But it’s the latter that matters. And beyond some level of enhancing individual productivity, it’s the team aspects that increasingly matter. Word processing is a good example of this. There used to be lots of experimentation and customization around individual features like typesetting. But once this was good enough, the focus has shifted towards collaboration. And for most use cases, few care about typesetting today. Increasingly our tools must understand and align with how we collaborate. This was less important when collaboration was logistically difficult and prohibitively costly, but as collaboration becomes easier its importance has risen. People’s work is less siloed—and their tools must reflect this.</p><p id="574dbdd0-6d32-4824-a4d8-ce4269503483" class="">

</p><p id="0e5d2219-3b3e-4fe5-85e6-23cce4077aa5" class="">Historically it has been very difficult for non-designers to be involved *during* the design process. If PMs, engineers, or even the CEO wanted to be involved, there were many logistical frictions. If they wanted the full designs, the designer would need to send them the current file. They’d then need to not only download it, but also make sure they had the right Adobe product or Sketch installed on their computer—costly tools that were hard to justify for those who didn’t design regularly. And these tools were large, slow, specialized programs that were unwieldy for those not familiar with using them. It was hard to navigate a project without a designer to walk you through it. Comments were done out of band in separate emails. Even worse, if a designer made an update before viewers had finished looking at the file, the file would be out of date—without the viewer being aware.</p><p id="3be90c5d-5f43-41ce-bf8a-17c74dc094d8" class="">
</p><p id="9707dc11-d17a-4ab0-bb7b-b31abfb849de" class="">The experience was just as bad for designers. Even if they wanted their PMs and engineers to give feedback, they’d need to handhold them through the process. Designers would have to export the designs into images, send the screenshot, and later figure out how to translate the feedback into changes in the actual design. The feedback loop was so slow that they’d need to pause their process while waiting for feedback.</p><p id="88069b1b-71e2-4c9c-a409-c2336eabcf5f" class="">

It’s impossible for a single company to build all the features and tools needed by each user. Platforms are needed most when the diversity and scale of use cases is larger than can be built—or often even understood—by the company. Sketch’s plugins allow the value to Sketch customers to grow at a faster pace than Sketch can ship new features. Figma will also likely stay focused on a generalized and core set of features, leaving a huge surface area of user workflows for plugins to address.</p><p id="5e01da58-8d51-44c1-a1ae-89114ec33411" class="">

More and more companies are reaching the scale and dynamic range where this is a priority, but for the most part, they are individually recreating the wheel. In a decade, there will be clear frameworks, metrics, and supporting ecosystems for building platforms; today there are few. This is a natural maturation, and one that all business models go through, such as SaaS and subscription over the last decade.</p><p id="72a67e64-9deb-449b-8fbe-f3e6febf77b0" class="">

The API is well documented and the plugin coverage is high. However, plugins are outside the scope of the core product. Users installing a plugin are most commonly directed to the Github page of the plugin, which they must manually download and install. This is another example of the gradients of what it means to put your product in the cloud. Even if Sketch is in the cloud, its plugins are local files. There is friction in downloading and installing them. This is compounded in a work setting as teams must manually make sure employees are using the same plugins if needed.</p><p id="191a1e5a-81db-4312-8c93-d50977faf086" class="">
</p><p id="ad55b4bc-0bd3-4d8e-9efc-88b5ae813fca" class="">Because plugins are not first-class citizens in the Sketch product and handled out of its scope, plugin management is very decentralized. Plugins can register to be listed on Sketch’s site and enable automatic updates, but otherwise Sketch is very hands-off. There is no official Sketch source for how popular a plugin is, nor do they have to approve plugins. Instead, users must rely on Github stars or reviews on third party sites. There is no oversight on plugins causing performance or stability issues.</p><p id="b1dcdec5-2183-4849-86dd-b8fee97bce1a" class="">
</p><p id="cd33b947-1b90-4e93-950a-70f89e704f68" class="">This shouldn’t be mistaken for criticism.

</p><p id="425fa6a4-b8f8-4f51-b26e-4992673b70a5" class="">Platforms are emergent ecosystems, more akin to building a consumer social network than a traditional enterprise sales company. This is one of the core dilemmas of building platforms. They are complex organic systems that have to be carefully cultivated (gardening vs. engineering mindset) and it’s hard to predict beforehand what direction they will go and the scale they will achieve.</p><p id="2ce33fea-f8f6-4bcf-b89f-9daf5d75b8b6" class="">
</p><p id="9900508a-1f72-435e-a3f3-bf9e5c3f4c43" class="">Sketch cannot be faulted. To this day it’s still unclear how ambitious plugins can and should be. By defaulting to a relative hands-off approach, they allowed the community to flourish unhindered by them. And it’s by seeing Sketch’s success with plugins, as well as their struggles, that others like Figma and Adobe XD have been able to have increased confidence in the importance, potential, and levers of a plugin ecosystem.</p><p id="4a71a79a-2ef3-40c9-bc34-f7315f78ae93" class="">

While safety, usability, and legal are about maintaining the integrity and trust of the platform, Figma’s business policies are about shaping what they think the plugin ecosystem <em>should</em> look like. For example, they allow monetization but prefer plugins be accessible to all users. Choices like how much to encourage an ecosystem of plugin businesses vs. a more open source community are important ones. There is no obviously correct answer, and it can and often needs to change over the life of a platform.

How should you balance encouraging growth today and building towards the ideal long term vision? To what degree should platforms influence which plugins get built or even which they should build themselves in the early days? How should you decide which features actually should be part of the platform itself vs. standalone plugins? How wide is the scope for what plugins can build?

</p><p id="6777a6ef-2765-464a-91b2-c24d64e1fe2d" class="">Perhaps Figma’s most interesting choice is the heavy focus on ease of plugin creation. Figma’s plugin system is explicitly designed to turn designers into developers by enabling them to create plugins for their own workflows. In most platforms and marketplaces, the ecosystem tends to split and professionalize over time. This is the natural gravitational pull of ecosystems*. To bet that a significant amount of the platform’s leverage will come from individuals improving their own workflows is a bold one. It’s a bet on induced demand, which is always the most interesting type of bet.</p><p id="0e58670b-8b0a-4cdf-8de7-c6c8e496caba" class="">
</p><p id="0a8c20e6-5b93-4720-b30f-c7077d921b37" class="">Figma’s plugin ecosystem is very nascent. From their <a href="https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/whats-supported/">list of supported features</a> and what’s to come, it’s clear that there is still a long way to go to open up their platform to more advanced plugins. And choosing the right abstraction layers for the plugin ecosystem is crucial. So far they have adopted a very strong stance on what the core technical decisions and promises around safety, performance, and stability need to be, but have been very hands-off on what plugins are built. This is to be expected early on. When it’s unclear what should be built, it’s not a bad policy to see where the creativity of the community leads. It often brings really amazing stuff, like this <a href="https://twitter.com/eminsinani/status/1263883853283950592">demo</a> of a plugin. Over time, however, we should expect to see more focus. Right now their <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/all">plugin page</a> is unsorted other than popularity and some that are featured. This works when the number of plugins is low enough, but eventually they will have to decide how to categorize plugins and what they want discovery to look like.</p><p id="2affc410-bf11-4e26-87ca-4a5b51a170ad" class="">
</p><p id="3b46d53b-64b6-490d-ad5b-23dfa01f76ad" class="">As plugin categories begin to crystallize, Figma will need to form crisp views on which areas should be absorbed into their core product, what they want each category to look like as it matures, what essential plugins don’t yet exist that they must help catalyze, and what new APIs they should allow plugins to address. The choice of how much to encourage monetization of the plugin ecosystem, as discussed above, is a perfect example of the kind of key decisions Figma will need to make (repeatedly) as they build out their plugin platform. Perhaps most importantly, Figma must decide the meta-framework by which to make these decisions intentionally rather than capriciously.</p><p id="3c2b5be8-7a0f-433c-87d8-334306f90d7b" class="">
