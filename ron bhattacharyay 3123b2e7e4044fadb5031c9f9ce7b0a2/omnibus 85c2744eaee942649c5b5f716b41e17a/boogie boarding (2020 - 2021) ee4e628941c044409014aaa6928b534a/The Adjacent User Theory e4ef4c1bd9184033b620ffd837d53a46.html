We were growing linearly, not exponentially. For many products that would be viewed as an amazing success, but for a viral social product like Instagram, linear growth doesn’t cut it. My job was to help the team accelerate and get back to exponential growth. Over the next 3 years, the growth team and I discovered why Instagram had slowed, developed a methodology to diagnose our issues, and solved a series of problems that reignited growth and helped us get to over a billion users by the time I left.</p><p id="f2c06fd0-ed9d-453d-b2e7-6fee04e8da92" class="">Our success was anchored on what I now call <em>The Adjacent User Theory</em>. <em>The Adjacent Users</em> are aware of a product and possibly tried using the it, but are not able to successfully become an engaged user. This is typically because the current product positioning or experience has too many barriers to adoption for them.</p><p id="dba87ec8-624a-4dfe-a215-c635ff9f1b7e" class="">While Instagram had product-market fit for 400+ million people, we discovered new groups of users who didn’t quite understand Instagram and how it fit into their lives. Our insight was that it is critical for growth teams to be continually defining who the adjacent user is, to understand why they are struggling, to build empathy for the adjacent user, and ultimately to solve their problems. And Adjacent User Theory doesn’t just apply to hyper-growth machines like Instagram, I’ve seen the dynamic play out again and again at plenty of other product-driven companies.</p><h1 id="a7b56f11-e08c-4548-8550-ce9d41d65692" class="">The Importance Of The Adjacent User</h1><p id="73ecd230-51f0-4349-b937-1d473a8396d0" class="">Solving for the Adjacent user is critical for a few reasons.</p><h2 id="5de461b3-232b-49db-8169-be1df0954c93" class=""><strong>Solving For The Adjacent User Captures The Potential Of Current Product Market Fit</strong></h2><p id="180d94c5-4b75-4464-b060-7f31d6fccf01" class="">When you have <a href="https://brianbalfour.com/essays/market-product-fit">Product-Market Fit</a>, you have healthy retention curves (they flatten out). But this isn’t the end goal. Your current retention doesn’t represent the true potential of your current product-market fit. There is a hypothetical retention curve that sits above that represents this true potential.</p><p id="4812025a-5543-4924-88ef-692cc588fd79" class="">What creates this gap? There are a set of users who show intent for your product but are not quite able to get over the hump. Those are your Adjacent Users. Solving for the Adjacent User through <a href="https://www.reforge.com/blog/product-work-beyond-product-market-fit?utm_source=ac&amp;utm_medium=blog">growth and scaling work</a> helps your product realize its true product-market fit potential.</p><figure id="1b56f0ee-0041-4ab3-a128-12106fdfbdf5" class="image"><a href="The%20Adjacent%20User%20Theory%20e4ef4c1bd9184033b620ffd837d53a46/current-pmf-retention.png"><img style="width:700px" src="The%20Adjacent%20User%20Theory%20e4ef4c1bd9184033b620ffd837d53a46/current-pmf-retention.png"/></a></figure><h2 id="9b50fc91-a0e1-4af2-9330-5c28ebf2d612" class=""><strong>The Impact Of Solving For The Adjacent User Compounds Over time</strong></h2><p id="a7eecd08-e4b8-45e5-86d8-ff9da1b34afd" class="">Every year there are massive efforts to getting voters to register and get to the polls.

This doesn’t just impact retention, but flows through your <a href="https://www.reforge.com/blog/growth-loops?utm_source=ac&amp;utm_medium=blog">growth loops</a> to <a href="https://www.reforge.com/blog/growth-metric-acquisition-monetization-virality?utm_source=ac&amp;utm_medium=blog">impact acquisition and monetization</a> as well.</p><h2 id="54c51751-4897-4968-ad32-650b7f9eeadc" class="">The Adjacent User Is A Different Way To Focus Product Efforts</h2><p id="ba402635-5161-4851-bc1d-5a38a758442a" class="">Most product teams know their existing users pretty well. But your future audience is always evolving. The challenges that these potential users face in adopting the product increase over time. Without a team dedicated to understanding, advocating, and building for your next set of users, you end up never expanding your audience. This stalls growth, and the product never reaches the level you aspire it to.</p><h1 id="6cdea564-6bb0-4847-b3d5-9e1efb32d58d" class="">Going Deeper On The Adjacent User</h1><p id="e98d22e6-d5f7-459f-8d35-da81484e438d" class="">You can think about your product as a series of circles. Each of these circles is defined by the primary user states that someone could be in. For example Power, Core, Casual, Signed Up, Visitor. Each one of these circles have users that are “in orbit” around it. These users have an equal or greater chance they drift off into space rather than crossing the threshold to the next state. There is something preventing them from getting over the hump and transitioning into the next state. These are your adjacent users and the goal is to identify who they are and understand their reasons struggling to adopt. As you solve for them, you push the edge of the circle out to capture more of that audience and grow.</p><figure id="6a5d4b06-c294-48cf-a90b-50c0b233e86a" class="image"><a href="The%20Adjacent%20User%20Theory%20e4ef4c1bd9184033b620ffd837d53a46/adjacentuser.png"><img style="width:700px" src="The%20Adjacent%20User%20Theory%20e4ef4c1bd9184033b620ffd837d53a46/adjacentuser.png"/></a></figure><h2 id="ab3c54a7-ca7a-412f-97c7-205181fb820c" class=""><strong>Instagram Example Of The Adjacent User</strong></h2><p id="880e75f1-0c41-41c9-a8f1-36c9a53e4e17" class="">Lets go through a couple of examples, starting with Instagram.

As we looked through that flow, it became an understandable problem. For someone that had never placed an order, there were tens of thousands of products, and this person wanted to find a specific product quickly. Our hypothesis was that current users were very high intent users who were willing to spend an hour filling up their cart versus driving to the store.

This is how you start uncovering behavior that explains aberrant data, or behavior for which data doesn’t exist.</p><h3 id="df0bf822-2e5f-4ef2-9c6b-5b7ad719dbe6" class="">Talk To The Adjacent User</h3><p id="3e28fbd9-7024-4abd-897e-6d6edf6b67b0" class="">The third technique is to talk to the adjacent user about why they are trying to use your product, what jobs they are trying to solve, and which <a href="https://brianbalfour.com/quick-takes/alternatives-not-competitors">alternatives</a> they are considering or have already tried. Surveys are fastest to deploy to get signal on where you should spend more time and focus. But surveys alone are not sufficient. You need to talk to users in person to go deeper.</p><p id="d9c79c60-61e1-4fb7-86ed-087111cbae3f" class="">At the beginning of the post I talked about the example at Instagram where we started to see a large increase in access churn (users logging out, then failing to log back in successfully). Two directions emerged. We could either make it harder for people to log out, or easier to log back in. But to determine which path was best, we needed to understand why people were logging out in increasing volumes.</p><p id="376fbea0-7b6d-4e91-b6fb-fe9111051018" class="">We decided to talk to a lot of users who were intentionally logging out. What we found were two things:</p><ol type="1" id="1a86a4f1-460a-4ed6-a2b5-c4d8206541e1" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>People had a real use case for logging out. They logged out either because they had a prepaid phone plan and were worried about background data usage, or they were sharing the phone with a family member.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="33c30c3d-5c21-4cc0-9244-5103ec2b2f7d" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li>These users also commonly used fake email addresses. Email addresses are more of a western paradigm, and new people to the internet internationally don’t use email, they just text.</li></ol><p id="93ae4e52-4f53-4af9-907c-9f2c320b4259" class="">Once we understood these two things, it was clear the right strategic direction was to work on making it easier to log back in vs harder to log out and we were able to come up with some creative solutions for the use cases.</p><h3 id="d9275d19-3ceb-40f2-834b-097c1b43dee4" class="">Visit The Adjacent User</h3><p id="3858cc2f-4032-4d04-91c7-d31817c8b0c6" class="">The last technique is to visit the adjacent user in their environment. Seeing how your adjacent user uses a product in their environment expands your understanding of their workflow, constraints, and needs. Are B2B customers constantly sharing screens with colleagues for a product that you previously thought of as a personal tool? Are users having performance or usability issues in the real world that you otherwise wouldn’t have considered? Users tend to employ their authentic workarounds and habits in their own environment, which you won’t see in a lab or other manufactured setting.</p><h1 id="17d591ef-f4df-4a6a-a060-cf8cb09fb499" class="">Sequencing Your Adjacent Users</h1><p id="77bd7506-8e3d-4113-9e31-15c010b4f709" class="">One of the biggest failure points is sequencing your adjacent users incorrectly. You want to pick the right adjacent users to go after so that you are building towards longer term value over time.</p><p id="be111c0d-f197-40dd-9c87-a39245c18d07" class="">If you are familiar with Geoffrey Moore Crossing The Chasm, he referred to something similar called the bowling alley strategy. Find one niche audience that if you solve for them, helps you get to the next audience.</p><p id="c03b286b-c406-4f30-8989-c7a5334c0257" class="">The center of Moore’s framework was Customer Maturity: Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards. Moore theorized that by solving for the problems of next set of likely adopters you enable the following segments. Adjacent User theory is similar. By enabling your immediate next set of adjacent users, you create the conditions that enable future segments. You can push the boundaries of the core user outcomes down to a lot of vectors, customer maturity being just one.</p><h2 id="a4cd7338-36bb-4f48-afc9-f014415428a2" class="">How To Think About Sequencing</h2><p id="79c079a8-731d-4a2e-b796-6b3828eafd63" class="">There are a few keys to sequencing segments of Adjacent Users.</p><p id="158db5f8-89ac-43cb-987c-64796457459d" class=""><strong>1. Adjacent User Should Only Be Different On One or Two Attributes</strong></p><p id="67b6cde7-aaa8-40b3-9742-54b950bb140c" class="">Let’s say you have 5 different vectors you can expand on. If your adjacent user definition is different on all 5 of those vectors, or even the majority, choosing that segment is a bad choice. That is like trying to hit a home run on every swing. It is probably going to take too many changes that are too large to enable that segment.</p><p id="12de8d28-d555-42ef-8af3-efac62a1cb5f" class="">You need the conviction that you can build something to validate or invalidate the adjacent user definition pretty quickly. The adjacent user is not about capturing one large definition at once, it is about layering on micro definition after micro definition.</p><blockquote id="e056e179-c61f-405b-8ad8-08970ebd2488" class="">Elena: “A segment that is different on multiple attributes typically requires enabling a new value prop to bring them into the product. That’s a very big swing. But it’s not an “if” you should be going after them, it’s a question of “when.” If you can first add smaller features for adjacent users that only differ on one attribute you can maintain momentum and growth velocity while working up to a new value prop for those multi-attribute users.”</blockquote><p id="cd75681a-ccaa-44af-a51a-0452de6bdca5" class=""><strong>2. Not All Adjacent Users Are Opportunities</strong></p><p id="10b577ff-d038-4c6b-826b-12c1562baa61" class="">As you explore your adjacent users, you are going to find a lot of possible segments. But just because they exist, does not mean you should choose to serve them. The key here is that the segment still needs to align with the strategic direction of where the product is going.</p><p id="8c61a20e-008f-446a-8ec7-d7ab43eefbac" class="">Sometimes you will have a lot of insight that an adjacent user exists, but you are unsure if serving them is meaningful and aligns with the strategic direction. This happened while working on Instagram. As we solved access churn (people churning because they had trouble logging back in) we noticed feed posts were going up. At first, we didn’t know why, but we eventually discovered people had 2nd and 3rd accounts that they were logging back into. One account was public-facing, and one was more private for friends. So the question came up, should we be more intentional about making it easier to create and navigate across multiple accounts? Is that meaningful? Does it align with the strategic direction of the product? We didn’t have a clear answer and therefore punted on that adjacent user until we had further validation that the 2nd account was an additive opportunity within our strategic direction.</p><p id="a760e123-18f0-4ad3-9786-44081b6a4b3f" class=""><strong>3. Solve In-House Problems First</strong></p><p id="4faec67d-c9b9-4c6c-bb34-ede158820567" class="">When choosing your adjacent users, it is typically better to solve “in-house” problems first. These are users that are already showing up in your funnel and product vs brand new users who aren’t there yet. Those that are already showing up are displaying intent, but having trouble finishing. Solving for them typically creates more short term impact.</p><blockquote id="6ed9ec59-54d1-42fb-b644-efbdff25528b" class="">Elena: *”For B2B products, the way I like to think about sequencing is:</blockquote><ol type="1" id="ee313f7a-d772-43a5-9a9d-72f4c245f349" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>First solve for those in the existing user base that can drive additional monetization.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="df72fa03-014e-4fc5-929f-17b2c28e0295" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li>Second, solve for those in the existing user base that drive additional value in indirect ways.

The impact is partially driven by the size of the segment today. But one mistake when thinking about impact is to not think about the impact on a longer time horizon. Often times one segment might be larger but not growing, while another could be smaller but have a much larger growth trajectory. When taking that trajectory into account, the second segment may be the better choice.</p><blockquote id="e6ab8245-5940-43e0-bdcd-4d388334d092" class="">Fareed: “When we were looking at international growth opportunities at Slack, we found that both users in France and India had far worse monetization. A lot of teams would have probably chosen to solve for French users since they are a higher income audience.</blockquote><p id="eaffd6df-2486-40a1-b5b3-8b68c61fd1bd" class="">But users in France weren’t growing and we didn’t have a clear hypothesis of why they weren’t monetizing. On the other hand, India was growing way faster and had a clear hypothesis as to why they weren’t paying. When looking at it on a slightly longer term horizon, solving for users in India was clearly the higher ROI opportunity.”</p><h1 id="97c9eb61-bf20-40b1-92f3-26825004346a" class="">The Evolving Adjacent User Landscape</h1><p id="4cf21e2e-0d32-4419-9e30-5339f0d56b17" class="">The landscape and understanding of your adjacent users are always evolving. When I started at Instagram, the Adjacent User was women 35 – 45 in the US who had a Facebook account but didn’t see the value of Instagram. By the time I left Instagram, the Adjacent User was women in Jakarta, on an older 3G Android phone with a prepaid mobile plan. There were probably 8 different types of Adjacent Users that we solved for in-between those two points.</p><p id="84300626-3739-4a66-854d-42ca3c70d77d" class="">Your Adjacent User is constantly changing for a few different reasons:</p><ol type="1" id="fb865efd-2bd1-43b3-83d6-c1c620c0c716" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li><strong>New Information</strong>As you experiment and solve for one adjacent user, you are constantly gaining new information. This can happen in a few ways:  <ul id="fb2b501c-c3ca-4f2e-93c5-b5e04e86610c" class="bulleted-list"><li><strong>Unexpected Result –</strong> You run an experiment and get a result you did not expect.</li></ul><ul id="9a224778-657f-41d7-ae17-c08348fecc85" class="bulleted-list"><li><strong>New Instrumentation –</strong> New data instrumentation creates visibility into what is happening in areas you didn’t have visibility before.</li></ul><ul id="db55b765-73aa-4560-ab6b-888f0e372ffc" class="bulleted-list"><li><strong>New Research –</strong> Through the course of user research to validate hypotheses, you uncover new hypotheses you hadn’t thought about before.</li></ul><p id="770f5bae-0e2f-402d-b25a-85d380da7087" class="">This new information informs updates to your current adjacent user hypotheses and possibly creates entirely new adjacent user segments.</p></li></ol><ol type="1" id="5211fff6-3460-4f4e-8787-7660b8d42d17" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li><strong>New Users Showing Up</strong>As you unlock value for one type of adjacent user, they often start bringing in a new type of adjacent user into your orbit. All healthy products have some acquisition through word of mouth. So when you solve for one adjacent user, their word of mouth brings in their friends who just might be your next type of adjacent user.Unlocking the 35-45yo women in US and Europe on IG brought WOM growth through families. This is an important age group for mothers who would create private IG accounts to share family and kid photos. This influenced their friends to do the same, inspired other relatives to sign up just to see these photos, and their partners ended up joining as well</li></ol><ol type="1" id="af6732b9-ab69-4ec6-91f9-634b580ade44" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li><strong>New Value Props</strong>As the product team enables new value props in the product, it can fundamentally change what the experience needs to be at the edges of user states for adjacent users to experience the product.At Instagram, this occurred when we launched Stories. Stories didn’t help activate new users. It actually made it harder. It was hard for new users to have available Stories content because it disappeared after 24hours. Users needed to follow a lot more accounts to have enough content on any given day. The bar was higher and it changed the experience of how we created activation and engagement.</li></ol><p id="4a4696b2-331b-409c-b53a-fff5fc772146" class="">Knowing that the adjacent user is constantly changing, we would reevaluate our understanding of the adjacent user every quarterly planning cycle based on l<a href="https://www.reforge.com/experimentation-testing?utm_source=ac&amp;utm_medium=blog">earnings from experimentation</a> and research. In addition, we would tend to have one off insights a couple of times per year from various events like unexplainable experiment results, press, surveys, or something else.

You must take the time to <a href="https://www.reforge.com/blog/good-experiment-bad-experiment?utm_source=ac&amp;utm_medium=blog">understand “the why’ behind your experimental results</a>. The why helps you understand the next adjacent user. If you don’t do this you can miss incredibly important shifts in user mindsets as you move from adjacent segment to segment. If you don’t take the time to understand the why behind your results, you miss the opportunity to build empathy and solve your adjacent user’s real problems.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="6e0fbf26-65eb-45a3-a5e2-75b01d057ca2" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li><strong>Constantly Working On the Fundamentals Of Registration, Activation, Engagement and Monetization</strong>Too often teams treat key flows in their product as projects. But the adjacent user highlights why you need to be constantly working on the fundamentals of registration, activation, engagement, and monetization. It’s a continuously evolving user challenge that you need to be constantly re-evaluating. The work never stops.Fareed: “In the early days of Instacart, the best performing landing page was an all white page, that said “<em>Instacart, Groceries delivered to your door, put your zip code in”</em>. Nothing else performed better. The user at that time was very high intent, tech savvy, urban millennial who knew what Instacart was because they heard about it from a friend through the press. As Instacart grew over time, you had to explain what Instacart was, why does it matter, who it is for, what stores we have. The same experiment on the white page a year later had dramatically different results because the adjacent user had changed.”</li></ol><ol type="1" id="dcea91f5-390b-44ff-9647-1975f093e9f8" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li><strong>Continually Cross The Cognitive Threshold Of Your Adjacent User</strong>At the beginning of this post, we talked about how working on the adjacent user requires you cross a cognitive threshold of seeing the product experience through their eyes. As the landscape of the adjacent user evolves, you and the team need cross this threshold over and over. It is easy to get sucked back into the gravity of your existing user base. But your job is to constantly expand the definition of who is successful with your product.</li></ol><p id="b4438b78-e3a7-4534-9356-12d83b6466a6" class="">All successful products must eventually shift their focus from core to adjacent users in order to maintain growth rates. Rapid success in your first audience will inherently lead to saturation and declining growth in that segment. While this is certainly an enviable problem to have, solving it is one of the most complex challenges in technology. The most successful companies are the ones that can continuously evolve to serve more adjacent users. The art is selecting the right groups of adjacent users to go after next. If you try to solve all problems for everyone, you’ll drown across too many issues and waste time acquiring users who have no chance of being successful today.</p><p id="c7214f76-b12d-4a64-b2cb-160e1c5dad5b" class="">Adjacent User Theory demands an entirely different approach to being ‘user centric’. Static personas are OUT. Dynamic evolving personas that incorporate product adoption behavior are the standard to strive for. Every 3-6 months during hyper growth, you have to reorient your team around the next adjacent user, what they care about, and what problems you are solving for them.</p><p id="ba0efe7c-af78-45dc-ac78-2959b53d347d" class="">As you are succeed, you’ll see improving cohort retention, engagement, and monetization in your target adjacent users.
