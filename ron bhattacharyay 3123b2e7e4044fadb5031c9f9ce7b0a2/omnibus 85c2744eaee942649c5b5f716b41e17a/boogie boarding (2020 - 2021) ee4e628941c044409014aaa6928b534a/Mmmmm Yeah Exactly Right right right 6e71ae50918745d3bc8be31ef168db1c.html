Between my Abuela’s couch, my friend Zein’s (interning at the Met) couch and bed, and my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/dillchen">DChen’s</a> (building Source at the time) couch and bed. Very communal, very open door… very Seinfeld the whole thing. I was the Kramer I suppose. I just walked in and made it home. Provided a joke and cheap beer to earn my keep.</p><p id="15fae922-4230-4330-919a-a6591281cc77" class="">And the story begins, I suppose a bit before graduation. Life really begins after resisting the temptation of blowing my brains out while interning in finance going into my junior year, and then the chip formed after getting denied by Bridgewater… most chips form out of a key denial I find. Probably why tech is such an insecure place, why we are so obsessed with narrative and status. Rewriting it all…</p><p id="be340342-8149-4b5d-b941-fbe0bf6277d4" class="">After that denial I knew where I wasn’t going to be, designed my own major but then skipped class to find out where I should be. Did a lot of things to find out where I should be. And very accidentally stumbled into co-founding an ed-tech startup. Being the “business half” to an engineering team. But hating the design, I commissioned a <a href="https://astronautmonastery.com/">friend</a> to help redesign the entire product with me. Not knowing anything formal about design, just trusting my taste.</p><p id="76aa8912-e8ae-4f97-b0bb-00db858ba7ba" class="">But there was a more pressing task, getting into more rooms with universities (our clients). More money. More validity to show the universities we could be trusted and useful. This led us to DreamIt’s ed-tech accelerator. Which was great because I didn’t have to drop out (the rest of the team had graduated)… even though mentally I was way out of school already.</p><p id="4b3ee4b1-0714-4ff9-9226-44b3057e6bec" class="">Not dragging this along too much, two key things happened before I would leave this ed-tech jawn. The first is I’d meet <a href="https://twitter.com/badboyboyce">Peter Boyce</a>. The second is we would get denied a check by Dorm Room Fund. This would work well together, even though at the time I was just blindingly upset.</p><p id="82814eda-39cb-4475-a81e-c2b86e180b08" class="">After deciding I hated ed-tech, didn’t vibe with my co-founder (sometimes you get into a marriage for the wrong reasons), and I (correction: my mom) wasn’t ready to actually drop out… I had to quickly find an internship for the summer.</p><p id="8e5ca3eb-ba54-479a-8578-c86d55acab4a" class="">Somehow, I get flown out to LA to interview for a weird niche internship at Snap. Get a verbal offer while at the office, then ghosted, and then the internship didn’t exist…</p><p id="a5f22a08-09e6-4e47-a24a-fe25b9026dbb" class="">So I end up interning for a small consumer joint in NYC. The founders pay me $500 a week, straight to my Venmo. And I just do whatever I can to help… which isn’t much. I still don’t really know how to work. But I was curious and too heady, and so they kept me. Maybe because they knew it was just for a summer.</p><p id="ee71dba0-8aa2-45b0-985b-8d0efcbb4f25" class="">In the back of my head, Dorm Room Fund was still annoying. And so I reached out to Peter and really started going at him about Rough Draft and why wasn’t it at Penn, and why was he letting Dorm Room Fund take all the Penn deals, and these were all the deals I could do first day as a partner. This continued for a whole summer. Either he started to believe me, or he just wanted me to stop, but we started RDV Penn that fall.</p><p id="6117a2ad-b708-4b01-9901-44a6bdee03b6" class=""><strong>Now I was identifiably — mmmmmmm yeah, I’m doing it.</strong></p><p id="23b33879-17bf-4ed7-adeb-723c6b096db2" class="">I was wearing the grey hoodie and the black tee everyday. Inhaling Marc Andreessen interviews. YC’s youtube channel replaced the classroom, other than a few product design classes… where I was generally uninspired but felt a sort of responsibility to my parents maybe…</p><p id="348e251d-f7da-4cb4-91ba-a3f6a564c77c" class="">The entirety of Senior year I spent taking the Bolt bus every other Friday up to GC NYC. Every early Friday morning, I knew I was in it.</p><p id="ec11716b-a615-4f2f-870a-9aed7b5e1f33" class="">I went to the Monkey offices at 1am. BOY WERE THEY IN IT! I watched a call counter go up by 1 million in the span of a couple hours. Ben… and that whole gang. That was a scene.</p><p id="f4551300-4425-4693-aa66-d86773fa5ec0" class="">Graduation does this funny thing. Where you feel like you don’t have to make any decisions or you have to make every decision. Plenty (at least at Penn) do that whole Southeast Asia tour thing. Which is plenty groovy, but I was set to “it’s time to build”. I already hated what social was becoming. And Peter had taken another, full of love, bet on me — RDV funding my company Sushi. Which if you never saw it, because we only had a few thousand users and I was just manically making every mistake possible, was an open group-chat app. Funny enough, imagine if instead of voice, Clubhouse was just open group chats capped at a certain amount of people. That’s what Sushi was.</p><p id="ae256ce8-c180-47d9-b00b-fb83f8f28a2a" class="">And now we are back to apartment hopping in LES. The routine was something like. DChen and I wake up around 10am. Work until 1am. Go down to Home Sweet Home and drink until 4am. Rage against the technium and what it could be. Repeat.</p><p id="6819ef6b-5697-4117-9132-faef5f539319" class="">Fall came. I got my own apartment in Red Hook. My summer squad went back to finish their last bit of school. Those from my year just moved to the city, BCG and Goldman and Facebook offers starting up. And I was utterly disconnected from all that. I didn’t even want to pretend to get close to understanding that whole ~thing~.</p><p id="981511ae-bb9b-490b-940c-70ab56ace2cf" class="">So what do you do when your company is kind of a thing but not a thing, and you want to break through, and you want to be in it again… you miss being in it again… æčïd</p><p id="89bd88bb-f280-49b4-b584-f4b98dbe3174" class="">You go to Prospect Park and watch clouds explode.

Super trippy, not fun.</p><p id="fc67ed83-a442-49a7-96ba-4868fb2dfa05" class="">My roommate was gone for months. At some hacker house in Austin. So no job, broken heat, spaghetti and coffee everyday. I just read and keep reading and journaling the same entry again and again. At the time I was also on this no-wifi in the apartment kick. Partially because of money, but also because I was curious what would happen if I really put my technology in its place.</p><p id="7cc7f681-287d-458d-bc89-9c6cb1bc218b" class="">But yeah… I was freaking out in this white box. Playing with my shadow. Until New Years. When some friends and I went to a Real Estate concert to ring in 2018. Maybe it was the music, the comfort of some real friends, something… but it brought me back in it…</p><p id="92b82fd5-1e15-4740-881f-6959bd39abc2" class="">I started to create just to create something. It started with a little photography and interview series. And snowballed into me writing about ~the themes~. What we as humans iterate on in perpetuity to extend ourselves. This pushed me into new mobility and access and how we touch our cities. I dm’d Ryan (founder of JUMP Bikes) a manifesto of why I had to work there… and then I worked there.</p><p id="67d388c9-553d-492c-9810-721be1ce6466" class="">Excited about the upcoming Sequoia round, knowing I’d be REALLY in it now… a month into being at JUMP.

My manager would actively block any new work I took on. Would call me entitled about the work I wanted to do. It was almost meme like in its cadence and self-contradiction.
