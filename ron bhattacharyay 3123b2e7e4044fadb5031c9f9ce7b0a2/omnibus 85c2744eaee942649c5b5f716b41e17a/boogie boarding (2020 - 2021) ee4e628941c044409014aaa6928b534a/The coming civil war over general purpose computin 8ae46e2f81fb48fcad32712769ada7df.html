For example, modern cars are computers we put our bodies in and Boeing 747s are flying Solaris boxes, whereas hearing aids and pacemakers are computers we put in our body.</li></ul><ul id="e5a71544-3fac-4e9c-a0fc-f47ce406f5e3" class="bulleted-list"><li>This means that all of our sociopolitical problems in the future will have a computer inside them, too—and a would-be regulator saying stuff like this:</li></ul><p id="43747b16-fff4-4479-852c-db71946115f0" class=""><em>&quot;Make it so that self-driving cars can&#x27;t be programmed to drag race&quot;</em></p><p id="7187cb59-e6f6-4900-8ce2-feec1c7d584b" class=""><em>&quot;Make it so that bioscale 3D printers can&#x27;t make harmful organisms or restricted compounds&quot;</em></p><p id="98daafab-402f-4da0-851d-d97da310f64f" class="">Which is to say: <em>&quot;Make me a general-purpose computer that runs all programs except for one program that freaks me out.&quot;</em></p><p id="acb80505-f554-42d3-926f-c543b6c1390f" class="">But there&#x27;s a problem. We don&#x27;t know how to make a computer that can run all the programs we can compile <em>except</em> for whichever one pisses off a regulator, or disrupts a business model, or abets a criminal.</p><p id="f6c21f1a-512e-450f-ab72-8c032d64fa46" class="">The closest approximation we have for such a device is a computer with <em>spyware</em> on it— a computer that, if you do the wrong thing, can intercede and say, &quot;I can&#x27;t let you do that, Dave.&quot;</p><p id="e6b90b58-f43f-4634-9564-a251dafc9377" class="">Such a a computer runs programs designed to be hidden from the owner of the device, and which the owner can&#x27;t override or kill. In other words: DRM. Digital Rights Managment.</p><p id="cd28ef5d-d3ac-457c-aba6-7410ba750d68" class="">These computers are a bad idea for two significant reasons. First, they won&#x27;t solve problems. Breaking DRM isn&#x27;t hard for bad guys. The copyright wars&#x27; lesson is that DRM is always broken with near-immediacy.</p><p id="c59d88fc-ea7b-478b-93f2-1181fcd96567" class="">DRM only works if the &quot;I can&#x27;t let you do that, Dave&quot; program stays a secret. Once the most sophisticated attackers in the world liberate that secret, it will be available to everyone else, too.</p><p id="535ba495-038f-4bac-974f-d1417b83d5aa" class="">Second, DRM has <em>inherently</em> weak security, which thereby makes overall security weaker.</p><p id="0790c688-4edf-4d25-a84e-57b70657c252" class="">Certainty about what software is on your computer is fundamental to good computer security, and you can&#x27;t know if your computer&#x27;s software is secure unless you know what software it is running.</p><p id="a43db6e6-01f7-430e-a60a-6fffc4d2f682" class="">Designing &quot;I can&#x27;t let you do that, Dave&quot; into computers creates an enormous security vulnerability: anyone who hijacks that facility can do things to your computer that you can&#x27;t find out about.</p><p id="02f237b9-099b-4d89-aed5-8438fe591c6f" class="">Moreover, once a government thinks it has &quot;solved&quot; a problem with DRM—with all its inherent weaknesses—that creates a perverse incentive to make it illegal to tell people things that might undermine the DRM.</p><p id="7e8e8bf6-ab56-45a6-8cb9-6dd9e5fa7fbb" class="">You know, things like how the DRM works. Or <em>&quot;here&#x27;s a flaw in the DRM which lets an attacker secretly watch through your webcam or listen through your mic.&quot;</em></p><p id="c188c8a4-7ddc-4005-a17b-9080f021cdb3" class="">I&#x27;ve had a lot of feedback from various distinguished computer scientists, technologists, civil libertarians and security researchers after 28C3. Within those fields, there is a widespread consensus that, all other things being equal, computers are more secure and society is better served when owners of computers can control what software runs on them.</p><p id="d1251d17-13da-4f08-9e3f-5a0165896487" class="">Let&#x27;s examine for a moment what that would mean.</p><p id="1e356378-ea9c-4c13-9d4e-a7c4ba854165" class="">Most computers today are fitted with Trusted Platform Module. This is a secure co-processor mounted on the motherboard. The specification of TPMs are published, and an industry body certifies compliance with those specifications.</p><p id="86b6d253-f2c9-4785-b9e2-31fad947c854" class="">To the extent that the spec is good (and the industry body is diligent), it&#x27;s possible to be reasonably certain that you&#x27;ve got a real, functional, TPM in your computer that faithfully implements the spec.</p><p id="300915e4-b22c-46b9-b4ef-6f1ec1e2c959" class="">How is the TPM secure? It contains secrets: cryptographic keys. But it&#x27;s also secure in that it&#x27;s designed to be tamper-evident. If you try to extract the keys from a TPM, or remove the TPM from a computer and replace it with a gimmicked one, it will be very obvious to the computer&#x27;s owner.</p><p id="e9ff22ff-fd70-4596-a221-ff111659d41a" class="">One threat to TPM is that a crook (or a government, police force or other adversary) might try to compromise your computer — tamper-evidence is what lets you know when your TPM has been fiddled with.</p><p id="1b2ceb58-c6a2-4cee-83e2-a9aa087be4e7" class="">Another TPM threat-model is that a piece of malicious software will infect your computer</p><p id="9f9dc394-d406-46f0-ac0f-58b951504423" class="">Now, once your computer is compromised this way, you could be in great trouble. All of the sensors attached to the computer—mic, camera, accelerometer, fingerprint reader, GPS—might be switched on without your knowledge. Off goes the data to the bad guys.</p><p id="cbdaabc2-3179-4a40-a5f3-5c7200176479" class="">All the data on your computer (sensitive files, stored passwords and web history)? Off it goes to the bad guys—or erased.</p><p id="051d398c-6a28-484e-82d2-f2cfe5ced975" class="">All the keystrokes into your computer—your passwords!—might be logged. All the peripherals attached to your computer—printers, scanners, SCADA controllers, MRI machines, 3D printers— might be covertly operated or subtly altered.</p><p id="b6d6f650-88ac-4194-a3a5-93b2cea7bdb8" class="">Imagine if those &quot;other peripherals&quot; included cars or avionics. Or your optic nerve, your cochlea, the stumps of your legs.</p><p id="ff8360f2-ec06-4a4b-86f7-ba929ab89a16" class="">When your computer boots up, the TPM can ask the bootloader for a signed hash of itself and verify that the signature on the hash comes from a trusted party. Once you trust the bootloader to faithfully perform its duties, you can ask it to check the signatures on the operating system, which, once verified, can check the signatures on the programs that run on it.</p><p id="c4fe9f33-a34c-4408-9879-cda3932f9d24" class="">Ths ensures that you know which programs are running on your computer—and that any programs running in secret have managed the trick by leveraging a defect in the bootloader, operating system or other components, and not because a new defect has been inserted into your system to create a facility for hiding things from you.</p><p id="a9c63d38-165e-4f89-8f8a-065d710abd21" class="">This always reminds me of Descartes: he starts off by saying that he can&#x27;t tell what&#x27;s true and what&#x27;s not true, because he&#x27;s not sure if he really exists.</p><p id="7f98f2f8-73f1-4fa6-917e-e5b0394fb244" class="">He finds a way of proving that he exists, and that he can trust his senses and his faculty for reason.</p><p id="7af085e9-a193-41cf-b6e6-a2e3019adb23" class="">Having found a tiny nub of stable certainty on which to stand, he builds a scaffold of logic that he affixes to it, until he builds up an entire edifice.</p><p id="76a59662-b0ea-43b8-bf86-e36df31e72dd" class="">Likewise, a TPM is a nub of stable certainty: if it&#x27;s there, it can reliably inform you about the code on your computer.</p><p id="f8b659dd-8e10-4b86-b343-3746bb3b2f02" class="">Now, you may find it weird to hear someone like me talking warmly about TPMs. After all, these are the technologies that make it possible to lock down phones, tablets, consoles and even some PCs so that they can&#x27;t run software of the owner&#x27;s choosing.</p><p id="f284f297-a047-4895-99ce-9bf66776c4f4" class="">Jailbreaking&quot; usually means finding some way to defeat a TPM or TPM-like technology. So why on earth would I want a TPM in my computer?</p><p id="b2396af0-ab09-4650-bc19-b966a46a43e9" class="">As with everything important, the devil is in the details.</p><p id="1be7a3e6-cd5d-4a5e-8198-a7ea9497f214" class="">Imagine for a moment two different ways of implementing a TPM:</p><p id="cc0012fd-ec52-45c2-a9a7-900b14d6c96c" class=""><strong>1. Lockdown</strong></p><p id="e0d83899-e6b5-40d8-9429-b48ecf92e5f9" class="">Your TPM comes with a set of signing keys it trusts, and unless your bootloader is signed by a TPM-trusted party, <em>you</em> can&#x27;t run it. Moreover, since the bootloader determines which OS launches, <em>you</em> don&#x27;t get to control the software in <em>your</em> machine.</p><p id="6027ca32-c05a-4356-9236-abbf566d4b81" class=""><strong>2.
