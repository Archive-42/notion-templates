Tumblr, was terrible. I will rephrase it just a little to make a point.</p><p id="ee42de88-d886-4e54-ab25-2673fba8c5c0" class="">Alice said something along the lines of “I hate people who frivolously diagnose themselves with autism without knowing anything about the disorder. They should stop thinking they’re ‘so speshul’ and go see a competent doctor.”</p><p id="6c0c5446-80b8-409a-b03e-ef6b6e5fef60" class="">Beth answered something along the lines of “I diagnosed myself with autism, but only after a lot of careful research. I don’t have the opportunity to go see a doctor. I think what you’re saying is overly strict and hurtful to many people with autism.”</p><p id="d78fcea2-d0ec-47d2-b1c9-fdffb82c135b" class="">Alice then proceeded to tell Beth she disagreed, in that special way only Tumblr users can. I believe the word “cunt” was used.</p><p id="b37aca70-4020-4faf-97f3-ad728d2794b1" class="">I notice two things about the exchange.</p><p id="b79af424-c9e7-401a-b377-face1fcd95c3" class="">First, why did Beth take the bait? Alice said she hated people who <em>frivolously</em> self-​diagnosed <em>without knowing anything about the disorder</em>. Beth clearly was not such a person. Why didn’t she just say “Yes, please continue hating these hypothetical bad people who are not me”?</p><p id="d37bb1d5-01a5-46dc-9fab-a990607648b6" class="">Second, why did <em>Alice</em> take the bait? Why didn’t she just say “I think you’ll find I wasn’t talking about you?”</p><h3 id="30fc81b7-516b-4a31-961c-b7236a9ebfc2" class="">II</h3><p id="f31a14d7-ed64-498b-a00a-2d0bd5399401" class="">One of the cutting-​edge advances in fallacy-​ology has been the <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/getting-duped/">weak man</a>, a terribly-​named cousin of the straw man. The straw man is a terrible argument nobody really holds, which was only invented so your side had something easy to defeat. The weak man is a terrible argument that only a few unrepresentative people hold, which was only <em>brought to prominence</em> so your side had something easy to defeat.</p><p id="dde5e819-a1e2-45ad-9b8a-213f2e053fe5" class="">For example, “I am a proud atheist and I don’t like religion. Think of the terrible things done by religion, like the actions of the Westboro Baptist Church. They try to disturb the funerals of heroes because they think God hates everybody. But this is horrible. Religious people can’t justify why they do things like this. That’s why I’m proud to be an atheist.”</p><p id="cd260894-1269-4b46-b296-2fc498ccf9a4" class="">It’s not a straw man. There really is a Westboro Baptist Church, for some reason. But one still feels like the atheist is making things just a little too easy on himself.</p><p id="50f34cb0-ec61-4aad-af37-d3935dc871c9" class="">Maybe the problem is that the atheist is indirectly suggesting that Westboro Baptist Church is typical of religion? An implied falsehood?</p><p id="e782f672-a2c5-42a8-b808-ccd3353970fc" class="">Then suppose the atheist posts on Tumblr: “I hate religious people who are rabidly certain that the world was created in seven days or that all their enemies will burn in Hell, and try to justify it through ‘faith’. You know, the sort of people who think that the Bible has all the answers and who hate anyone who tries to think for themselves.”</p><p id="59135d3d-76b1-4c0f-86d4-c26f81ef175c" class="">Now there’s practically no implication that these people are typical. So that’s fine, right?</p><p id="5275a1fc-44d8-477c-be52-d07a4d8ff79e" class="">On the other side of the world, a religious person is writing “I hate atheists who think morality is relative, and that this gives them the right to murder however many people stand between them and a world where no one is allowed to believe in God”.</p><p id="798f14fa-0e0d-4e01-8393-d3bc61d92847" class="">Again, not a straw man. The Soviet Union contained several million of these people. But if you’re an atheist, would you just let this pass?</p><p id="559320ab-7af5-4835-b768-5e1cf831ec6f" class="">How about “I hate black thugs who rob people”?</p><p id="9a983c5a-1e3e-4622-97e7-27e7d351c3dc" class="">What are the chances a black guy reads that and says “Well, good thing I’m not a thug who robs people, he’ll probably <em>love</em> me”?</p><h3 id="09903482-df59-479e-ac3e-05465626a530" class="">III</h3><p id="4f502640-533d-4043-901b-05562fb65ecc" class="">What is the problem with statements like this?</p><p id="fca19110-aec0-414a-96ea-7521fff3e0ad" class="">First, they are meant to re-​center a category. Remember, people think in terms of categories with central and noncentral members – a sparrow is a central bird, an ostrich a noncentral one. But if you live on the Ostrich World, which is inhabited only by ostriches, emus, and cassowaries, then probably an ostrich seems like a pretty central example of ‘bird’ and the first sparrow you see will be fantastically strange.</p><p id="1e836e0e-6c71-4f07-9144-b8136676619c" class="">Right now most people’s central examples of religion are probably things like your local neighborhood church. If you’re American, it’s probably a bland Protestant denomination like the Episcopalians or something.</p><p id="3c02e5eb-8b09-43b8-b002-dfa4bd0d6a1e" class="">The guy whose central examples of religion are Pope Francis and the Dalai Lama is probably going to have a different perception of religion than the guy whose central examples are Torquemada and Fred Phelps. If you convert someone from the first kind of person to the second kind of person, you’ve gone most of the way to making them an atheist.</p><p id="2a2fdaae-1336-4d26-8679-535247e0ab39" class="">More important, if you convert a culture from thinking in the first type of way to thinking in the second type of way, then religious people will be unpopular and anyone trying to make a religious argument will have to spend the first five minutes of their speech explaining how they’re not Fred Phelps, honest, and no, they don’t picket any funerals. After all that time spent apologizing and defending themselves and distancing themselves from other religious people, they’re not likely to be able to make a very rousing argument for religion.</p><h3 id="14d9e1bc-24ac-4d08-8975-45043f57ac8e" class="">IV</h3><p id="24527de8-64c0-4071-8220-b8447b3ac927" class="">In <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/15/the-cowpox-of-doubt/">Cowpox of Doubt</a>, I mention the inoculation effect. When people see a terrible argument for an idea get defeated, they are more likely to doubt the idea later on, even if much better arguments show up.</p><p id="62035f31-9268-4133-a2ea-b5d2bce94085" class="">Put this in the context of people attacking the Westboro Baptist Church. You see the attacker win a big victory over “religion”, broadly defined. Now you are less likely to believe in religion when a much more convincing one comes along.</p><p id="494f0f78-3599-4b9b-90fb-6f861be3f5ab" class="">I see the same thing in atheists’ odd fascination with creationism. Most of the religious people one encounters are not young-​earth creationists. But these people have a dramatic hold on the atheist imagination.</p><p id="69d5243f-322f-4bed-8b31-e4e90bfadd15" class="">And I think: well, maybe if people see atheists defeating a terrible argument for religion enough, atheists don’t <em>have to</em> defeat any of the others. People have already been inoculated against religion. “Oh, yeah, that was the thing with the creationism. Doesn’t seem very smart.”</p><p id="20dc3690-31b4-4d35-bd15-748503e07714" class="">If this is true, it means that all religious people, like it or not, are in the same boat. An atheist attacking creationism becomes a deadly threat for the average Christian, even if that Christian does not herself believe in creationism.</p><p id="4048e445-2ba2-4952-8186-49d273bb9eb9" class="">Likewise, when a religious person attacks atheists who are moral relativists, or communists, or murderers, then all atheists have to band together to stop it somehow or they will have successfully poisoned people against atheism.</p><h3 id="b1137cd3-6133-41b5-8d40-c1461683b7d1" class="">V</h3><p id="7345d6d2-0d2e-4b2e-81ab-f2557bc81134" class="">This is starting to sound a lot like <a href="http://squid314.livejournal.com/329171.html">something I wrote on my old blog about superweapons</a>.</p><p id="2b2b0f8c-0f41-45ce-9180-776d0720db67" class="">I suggested imagining yourself in the shoes of a Jew in czarist Russia. The big news story is about a Jewish man who killed a Christian child. As far as you can tell the story is true. It’s just disappointing that everyone who tells it is describing it as “A Jew killed a Christian kid today”. You don’t want to make a big deal over this, because no one is saying anything objectionable like “And so all Jews are evil”. Besides you’d hate to inject identity politics into this obvious tragedy. It just sort of makes you uncomfortable.</p><p id="463898ef-67f7-4345-8256-73a16fba09bc" class="">The next day you hear that the local priest is giving a sermon on how the Jews killed Christ. This statement seems historically plausible, and it’s part of the Christian religion, and no one is implying it says anything about the Jews today. You’d hate to be the guy who barges in and tries to tell the Christians what Biblical facts they can and can’t include in their sermons just because they offend you. It would make you an annoying busybody. So again you just get uncomfortable.</p><p id="2675aba3-d9aa-49ba-9e56-72ca6e9c4e97" class="">The next day you hear people complain about the greedy Jewish bankers who are ruining the world economy. And really a disproportionate number of bankers are Jewish, and bankers really do seem to be the source of a lot of economic problems. It seems kind of pedantic to interrupt every conversation with “But also some bankers are Christian, or Muslim, and even though a disproportionate number of bankers are Jewish that doesn’t mean the Jewish bankers are disproportionately active in ruining the world economy compared to their numbers.” So again you stay uncomfortable.</p><p id="2c7894b1-473b-427d-9ee3-88502e74080e" class="">Then the next day you hear people complain about Israeli atrocities in Palestine (what, you thought this was past czarist Russia? This is future czarist Russia, after Putin finally gets the guts to crown himself). You understand that the Israelis really do commit some terrible acts. On the other hand, when people start talking about “Jewish atrocities” and “the need to protect Gentiles from Jewish rapacity” and “laws to stop all this horrible stuff the Jews are doing”, you just feel worried, even though you personally are not doing any horrible stuff and maybe they even have good reasons for phrasing it that way.</p><p id="0803aa00-2c62-4e25-a8ca-48f88109ce8f" class="">Then the next day you get in a business dispute with your neighbor. Maybe you loaned him some money and he doesn’t feel like paying you back. He tells you you’d better just give up, admit he is in the right, and apologize to him – because if the conflict escalated everyone would take his side because he is a Christian and you are a Jew. And everyone knows that Jews victimize Christians and are basically child-​murdering Christ-​killing economy-​ruining atrocity-​committing scum.</p><p id="bd5119ff-dcd7-464a-b512-6698babf313a" class="">You have been boxed in by a serious of individually harmless but collectively dangerous statements. None of them individually referred to you – you weren’t murdering children or killing Christ or owning a bank. But they ended up getting you in the end anyway.</p><p id="3a29cfbb-117d-4fae-ac95-0f7c2f530b80" class="">Depending on how likely you think this is, this kind of forces Jews together, makes them become strange bedfellows. You might not like what the Jews in Israel are doing in Palestine.

The MRA cause is not helped by attacking people who speak truthfully.  [But the consequence of a] false positive is that a man ends up married to a skank, sociopath or gold digger. The cost of bad wife selection is so high that he is forced to turn away good women for fear of mistakenly choosing a bad one.</blockquote><p id="621bbaf0-6375-4fb9-a5f9-450a5018f3fe" class="">More polite and scientific than the feminist version, but the point is he expects men’s rights readers to be so familiar with “not all women are like that” that he’s perfectly comfortably abbreviating it NAWALT.
