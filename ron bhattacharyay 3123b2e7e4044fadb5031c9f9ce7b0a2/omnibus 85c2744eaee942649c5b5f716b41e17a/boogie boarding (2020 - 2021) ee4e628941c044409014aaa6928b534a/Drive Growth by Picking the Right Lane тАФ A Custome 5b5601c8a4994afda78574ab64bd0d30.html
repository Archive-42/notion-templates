class="page-body"><p id="69194fc7-f603-424b-a4e7-57cb6fd693bc" class=""><em>This article is by</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/danhockenmaier"><em>Dan Hockenmaier</em></a> <em> (founder of growth strategy firm</em> <a href="https://www.basisone.com/"><em>Basis One</em></a> <em>and former director of growth marketing at Thumbtack) and</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/lennysan"><em>Lenny Rachitsky</em></a> <em>(a former product lead and head of consumer supply growth at Airbnb).</em></p><p id="e7f0364a-6ee7-442c-bdec-121496e1f64b" class="">As advisors to early and growth-stage companies, we spend a lot of time talking to founders about growth. One of the more common questions we hear, especially early on, is about finding <em>more</em> ways to grow. The questions are often phrased like, “How can we add some SEO?” or “How can we make our product more viral?”</p><p id="0989aee8-b813-45c3-9a38-47856452d82e" class="">Unfortunately, this often leads to founders running head-first into one of the most common startup failure modes: investing in too many channels at once, and as a result not investing in any one channel enough. As an example, betting big on both SEO and virality <em>feels</em> like a really good idea (“We’ll grow twice as fast!”), but in practice it rarely works. And it’s often not clear that either of these routes are even the right channels for your business to begin with. We find ourselves repeating this same advice over and over, and so in the hope of saving startups time and heartache, we decided to put our thoughts to paper.</p><p id="e9353c9d-dcc2-4f36-88e4-3bba551e6b47" class="">In our experience, founders are often surprised to learn that there are very few routes to scalable new customer acquisition. For consumer companies, there are only <em>three</em> growth “lanes” that comprise the majority of new customer acquisition:</p><ul id="ab4fc690-71bb-4037-87d6-8968d020fe1e" class="bulleted-list"><li><strong>1. Performance marketing</strong> (e.g. Facebook and Google ads)</li></ul><ul id="9c4311a1-1f80-47d4-bd15-ee51e0a38509" class="bulleted-list"><li><strong>2. Virality</strong> (e.g. word-of-mouth, referrals, invites)</li></ul><ul id="4889da13-4509-4dcb-82fb-4450e6907c74" class="bulleted-list"><li><strong>3. Content</strong> (e.g. SEO, YouTube)</li></ul><p id="4affcfe3-c633-4406-9491-7def0cb2d881" class="">There are two additional lanes (sales and partnerships) which we won&#x27;t cover in this post because they are rarely effective in consumer businesses. And there are other tactics to <em>boost</em> customer acquisition (e.g PR, brand marketing), but the lanes outlined above are <em>the only reliable paths for long-term and sustainable business growth</em>.</p><p id="9fb6415c-4a47-4770-9ed0-67489e908f23" class="">To demonstrate this point, look back at the most successful consumer businesses of the last 10 years — every company achieved initial scale in a market by excelling at just one of three lanes:</p><figure id="d2d13df6-25d7-46dd-a0ee-3a6473156e1f" class="image"><a href="Drive%20Growth%20by%20Picking%20the%20Right%20Lane%20%E2%80%94%20A%20Custome%205b5601c8a4994afda78574ab64bd0d30/LWy8mBx1TRqe5T0jfn6C_CATEGORY20CHART.001.jpeg"><img style="width:700px" src="Drive%20Growth%20by%20Picking%20the%20Right%20Lane%20%E2%80%94%20A%20Custome%205b5601c8a4994afda78574ab64bd0d30/LWy8mBx1TRqe5T0jfn6C_CATEGORY20CHART.001.jpeg"/></a></figure><blockquote id="4c1c61ae-2d28-4742-96c7-b761bb9f060e" class="">The good news is that you generally only need to excel at one lane to build a successful business. The bad news is that it won’t be easy.</blockquote><p id="b0c74156-8280-4e7b-8599-5ab7a3132ef9" class="">Once you get to even moderate scale, each of these lanes becomes highly competitive. In the case of paid marketing and SEO, you are competing for a customer’s attention. Paid marketing becomes a business model competition (who can turn this customer attention into enough value that they can bid more than anyone else for that attention), and SEO becomes a ranking algorithm competition (who can capitalize on their content in such a way that “deciders” like Google want to continue to send traffic their way).</p><p id="8f40f090-3aaf-4a37-896a-10d670eefd3a" class="">In the case of virality, you are competing for something even more precious: a customer’s social standing. Consumers only want to recommend things that improve their relationships by genuinely helping other people with great recommendations, or perhaps just making them look cool. You can increase referrals with the right UX and incentives, but only to an extent.</p><p id="f0930e19-777f-4493-a93c-1e750b89678f" class="">Over time, companies typically layer on additional lanes (e.g. Thumbtack adding performance marketing on top of SEO) as they reach diminishing returns on their early growth channels, but in almost every case companies start with just one successful lane.</p><p id="e4f0fec4-a1b1-4b71-949d-6d545acc272a" class="">You may be wondering — why are there so few ways for companies to grow? Well, it’s because there are only a few ways for people to find out about new products. Think about it — how do <em>you</em> find out about new products? You either hear about it from a friend (i.e. virality), you come across it while doing something unrelated (i.e. content or performance marketing), or you get contacted directly by the company (i.e. sales, partnerships). That’s it. These are effectively the only channels companies have to find new customers. And thus, there are very few “lanes” for sustained growth.</p><p id="882c3009-6471-46c9-b866-7219408ea347" class="">Dan Hockenmaier (founder of growth strategy firm Basis One and former director of growth marketing at Thumbtack)</p><p id="885c03c8-4d04-4ac3-a641-8effd78e548f" class="">Below, we’ll share our framework for picking your lane, walk you through three case studies of companies that became world-class at a lane, and then tackle some frequently asked questions. To develop this playbook, we interviewed founders, embarked on primary research, and drew from our own experiences at Airbnb and Thumbtack.</p><p id="a62739f0-a4ad-4136-9113-07abac51f8e0" class="">An important note before we go further: While there are just three growth lanes for consumer businesses, this does not mean that there are just three “playbooks” to drive growth — or that there will never be other options.</p><blockquote id="afa92be9-f8c8-4bda-89d8-1c076b9ed2d2" class="">New lanes occasionally open up.

If they’ve been highly successful using a particular lane, it may mean you can be as well. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Barton">Rich Barton</a> founded three companies that all ultimately mastered the Content lane: Glassdoor, Expedia, and Zillow. While these companies compete in different industries, they share similarities in customer searching patterns and content generation, and he has been able to repeatedly capitalize on this approach.</p><h3 id="2f468149-12ac-4a68-abda-c40d04ff1280" class="">Approach 2: Look at your data</h3><p id="0dc70570-6afb-4821-a94c-0d357ac2d22f" class="">In a perfect world you could validate a lane through a live test, but the time and effort involved in directly testing each lane is highly variable. Performance marketing could take as little as 2-4 weeks to test. Virality (such as launching a referral program) can often be tested in 1-2 months. SEO typically requires the most investment, and many companies see zero results for 3 or more months.</p><p id="7bd0866a-335b-47b7-a1ff-8a32faa1a7af" class="">For this reason, you’ll see that validating paid marketing is most often done directly through testing, SEO often validated entirely through third-party data (e.g. Google Keyword Planner), and virality is somewhere in the middle. Here are our recommendations for the signal to look for to validate a lane through data:</p><p id="00f9929e-f4ba-45c9-8e66-c9dc1cc9dcc2" class=""><strong>Paid marketing: Your tests generate paying customers with a healthy payback period</strong></p><p id="dc652dda-6190-4753-8914-f59bfa9e0a5c" class="">Because it is relatively easy and cheap to launch paid marketing tests through channels such as Facebook or AdWords, simply getting tests of the ground should be the core of your validation strategy.</p><p id="d991482f-261b-4aac-bf7f-58bea0d9d616" class="">The most important metric to measure is payback period: the amount of time it takes you to earn back what you spent to acquire a customer. This is critical because it determines how quickly you can re-invest in more paid marketing. For most businesses, the payback period is only going to lengthen as you scale, so it needs to be pretty good from the start. Otherwise you need to have a clear line of sight to improving it, such as through conversion rate or monetization improvements.</p><p id="ff480739-6b57-4bcc-a9ba-d0fd2ad522ae" class="">For low frequency transactional businesses (e.g. buying car insurance), a common benchmark to target is payback on the first purchase. For high frequency transactional businesses or subscription businesses (ecommerce, media subscriptions), payback within 6-12 months would generally be considered healthy.</p><p id="4de6b638-2b8f-4487-8e6e-0a8db782830a" class=""><strong>Virality: Over 50% of your new customer acquisition today is through word-of-mouth, customers are naturally telling their friends and family about your product, and you’ve run a handful of successful experiments that increase this behavior.</strong></p><p id="fc8a3c6c-d330-441f-8aeb-f49bbbd2c0f3" class="">If your most satisfied customers aren’t already talking about your product or sharing it with their friends naturally, it’s going to be hard to make virality the cornerstone of your customer acquisition strategy.</p><p id="e32f619a-7e54-44e2-8bd7-5b556b100920" class="">Even if they are, you also want to understand if you have the ability to influence this behavior, such as through an experiment where you encourage customers to share.</p><p id="0a5a80c7-4a6c-4cae-83ee-ebba2998ad38" class=""><strong>Content: There is a high volume of keywords that are relevant to your product, and these keywords are not dominated by competitors that will be difficult to unseat.</strong></p><p id="cc2787d6-2679-4875-a7dd-0044c1160820" class="">Keyword research through a tool like <a href="https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/">Keyword Planner</a> can help you understand search volume for queries that are relevant to your business. You’re looking for keywords that are directly relevant to your product. If you sell wedding dresses online, a keyword like “buy wedding dress online” is much more relevant than “cost of a wedding dress.&quot; The former has 1-10K searches per month, according to Keyword Planner.</p><figure id="f79db581-4373-46e3-b74d-0e20db185a42" class="image"><a href="Drive%20Growth%20by%20Picking%20the%20Right%20Lane%20%E2%80%94%20A%20Custome%205b5601c8a4994afda78574ab64bd0d30/KCXnjNPqQOurHhZ8CUFF_Wedding20dress20keyword.png"><img style="width:700px" src="Drive%20Growth%20by%20Picking%20the%20Right%20Lane%20%E2%80%94%20A%20Custome%205b5601c8a4994afda78574ab64bd0d30/KCXnjNPqQOurHhZ8CUFF_Wedding20dress20keyword.png"/></a></figure><p id="30f50171-c47f-4e7d-a88d-d4191aa9d88b" class="">Similarly, you can search for these keywords to see who is currently ranking for them, to understand how stiff the competition will be.

Here is how he described the strategy in the early days:</p><p id="078c362f-7ce7-4ff6-ab0a-ed9fd6ce5cbb" class=""><em>Resources were limited, so we took the approach that we needed to choose bets carefully, and when we did choose, to go all in with basically 100% of our resources. We viewed everything else as a distraction.</em></p><p id="d333d73b-10b9-4a93-9bfe-776b9203348d" class="">But where was the right area to focus? The team brainstormed through hundreds of ideas to drive growth: email, blogs, guerilla marketing, partnerships, paid marketing, and so on.</p><p id="d55744c7-9652-4325-9e5f-6d83833c2085" class="">Then one day, another Thumbtack founder was at a bar in the Castro, and struck up a conversation with a stranger. When the conversation turned to Thumbtack, the stranger opened up his phone, did some searches, and said, “You know… you have an enormous SEO opportunity.” This kicked off a chain reaction that ultimately helped Thumbtack reach breakout scale. And that stranger ultimately became an angel investor, mentor, and first outside board member — but that’s a different story.</p><p id="5f5a9328-525f-41ec-9cc9-a0288fde35da" class="">Sander describes how the team validated that SEO was the right approach:</p><p id="9bb444e8-671a-463c-8fe4-7c21166b34a9" class=""><em>“It wasn’t just a random bet, it was a calculated one. We validated it in three primary ways, and these three things combined gave us confidence that if we executed well, the channel would pay off:</em></p><ul id="3017999e-5acd-4a52-a0d9-77360016eaa8" class="bulleted-list"><li><strong>Keyword research.</strong> <em>“We looked at the Google Keyword tool and saw that there were people out there searching in volume for keywords that matched what our product offered. People are out there searching for “movers in Austin” and “electricians in Tallahassee”. And for example, they’re not searching for “app to communicate with my friends where my messages disappear after they’re viewed”. So for Snapchat, SEO makes no sense.”</em></li></ul><ul id="fe13e2e0-9421-400d-9eaa-e7c0ea98f7f6" class="bulleted-list"><li><strong>Competitive research.</strong> <em>“We looked at the competition and saw that it wasn’t a supersaturated space.

When we get to Step 2, we’ll share how Thumbtack built their first growth team and committed to this lane.</p><h3 id="5cf0ded2-de99-4be5-89be-1d1c4a488bea" class="">Case study #2: How Airbnb validated virality</h3><p id="e9dbcf9d-72b8-4f3a-95b2-c1b1a87961fb" class="">The majority of <a href="https://firstround.com/review/How-design-thinking-transformed-Airbnb-from-failing-startup-to-billion-dollar-business/">Airbnb’s early growth</a> was driven by word-of-mouth: Travelers telling their friends about the great time they had staying at Airbnbs, and hosts telling their friends about the income they’re making hosting on Airbnb.</p><p id="f16b86db-9b22-4217-8626-d004b2c28504" class="">As the company matured, accelerating growth became a topic of conversation. There was already a small team working on performance marketing (accounting for about 10% of bookings), and a nascent SEO team, but the vast majority of growth continued to come from word-of-mouth (over 50% of bookings). At this point, Airbnb had three choices: double-down on what’s already working (word of mouth), invest further in one of these potentially untapped opportunities (paid or SEO), or try something completely new. The team decided to double-down — to invest in accelerating word-of-mouth further. And this investment led to the one of the biggest accelerations of growth in Airbnb history.</p><p id="4515afe3-f017-44a9-8ca3-1b4a4b1df666" class="">How did the team make this decision? <strong>First, they looked at the natural behavior of what was already happening — strong word of mouth</strong>. They had a hypothesis that amplifying an existing behavior would be a lot more effective than trying to create a new one, and noticed that a lot of users took screenshots of Airbnb listings to send to friends — a behavior that could be facilitated with product.</p><p id="a889998b-4811-42c4-a9fc-270bb403a7c5" class="">Second, there was <strong>data from a nascent referral program already in place</strong> built by co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/blecharczyk/">Nate Blecharczyk</a>, which was seeing some use, despite the lack of resources behind it. Here&#x27;s how <a href="https://twitter.com/gustaf"><strong>Gustaf Alströmer</strong></a> tells it:</p><p id="d6773f8c-a1be-449f-870b-fd512433b663" class=""><em>&quot;Airbnb actually launched a referrals program in 2011 but it was kind of forgotten.</em></p><p id="7c989e65-ffc9-4097-b172-cd4f6898f5a8" class=""><em>Over time, the general consensus was that referrals didn’t really work and that it wasn’t worth spending time on. But luckily we were storing a bunch of data, and when we looked at it again, we noticed we were generating millions of dollars in revenue from this program. Plus, we had a great base of data that we could tell there was a lot of room to expand it.”</em></p><p id="3b1d1c1a-6b19-4adc-b128-f8daedcb3d93" class="">Original Airbnb referrals program</p><p id="6272e0bd-6648-40a9-af30-83838a13ab30" class="">And third, they looked at <strong>benchmarks for analogous consumer companies</strong>, and saw they were finding a lot of success from investing in word-of-mouth based programs, such as a referral program.</p><p id="3df7fc92-996d-4bb6-a4e2-22279c6eb7db" class="">With all of that validation, the Airbnb team committed to taking a shot at accelerating this channel.</p><h3 id="0bb62968-0de3-4b9a-9337-4fbaaf2d6ac5" class="">Case study #3: How Booking.com validated performance marketing</h3><figure id="c47c70a8-c9bf-4429-a483-8d537c0d369c" class="image"><a href="Drive%20Growth%20by%20Picking%20the%20Right%20Lane%20%E2%80%94%20A%20Custome%205b5601c8a4994afda78574ab64bd0d30/3F06hYdKT4eGBi3OlLv2_Original20Booking.com20landing20page20for20Paris20.png"><img style="width:700px" src="Drive%20Growth%20by%20Picking%20the%20Right%20Lane%20%E2%80%94%20A%20Custome%205b5601c8a4994afda78574ab64bd0d30/3F06hYdKT4eGBi3OlLv2_Original20Booking.com20landing20page20for20Paris20.png"/></a></figure><p id="b9b071a9-5b34-4b3b-8a81-0f7d6081628e" class="">Original Booking.com landing page for Paris.</p><p id="82191955-9480-4451-84ee-5f4f90e75ef7" class="">Unlike Airbnb, Booking.com’s early growth came from through SEO. But it quickly slowed down. Here’s how <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthurkosten/"><strong>Arthur Kosten</strong></a> (CMO of Booking.com from 2003 to 2012) tells it:</p><p id="753a335f-4f01-42e9-90ee-002df24962ab" class=""><em>“The founding company behind Booking.com (bookingsportal) actually started off as a meta-search business, and SEO was a growth driver early on.

At the time, Google was taking off like a rocket ship, and the users had so much purchase intent while searching. We thought, if we could get good at Google, we’d do really well. We thought – what if we try AdWords?’</em></p><p id="aed3e305-2535-4095-95be-187c9386c298" class="">And so with this natural extension of their SEO work, <strong>the team ran some early paid ad tests</strong>. Kosten continues:</p><p id="0f633603-1578-4d18-8d2b-e7846018e6f0" class=""><em>“We happened to have a bunch of simple templated landing pages (e.g. “Hotels in Paris”) from our SEO experiments that were easy to test with paid ads. So we ran some tests. And these tests showed a lot of promise – payback was immediate with the first transaction. As we were almost completely bootstrapped and cash constrained, we didn&#x27;t have the luxury of investing marketing budget for future growth.</em></p><p id="cb5af1c1-dd9b-4528-83fb-46f437ec343d" class=""><em>People talk about product/market fit. We realized we needed product/channel fit. And it became clear Google AdWords was that for us.”</em></p><p id="00f21e56-de25-4a2e-bcb5-b44baaab52fa" class="">And so with this early validation, Booking.com took their landing page strategy to the extreme – which we’ll explore in Step 2.</p><h2 id="8acf654e-944e-4f95-918d-aeb27002b3e4" class="">STEP 2: COMMIT</h2><p id="e2eb7964-64d8-4f17-b861-637b1541b388" class="">Once you’ve validated a channel, the next step is to commit to the lane.

Sander Daniels describes what the team was facing:</p><p id="ff35723c-cd47-40fb-b5a9-84e7418a8892" class=""><em>“SEO was a big bet because it takes a long time to see results.

This meant investment in three primary areas:</p><p id="f27522ab-3d38-4f1f-b538-f003e35caf03" class=""><strong>1. Site architecture</strong></p><p id="24a18045-4a51-46aa-8059-a64a30fbd08b" class="">The team built out thousands of pages targeted at high value keywords, and optimized their entire website and URL structure for SEO. This meant making it as understandable and crawlable by googlebot as possible. Importantly, in some areas this came at the expense of the user experience. These were hard tradeoffs to make, especially before SEO was yielding any benefits.</p><p id="eb9684a7-6824-4ecb-80df-6efbe102ce46" class="">One example was the geographically-based “directory” structure Thumbtack built. The incumbents in the space at the time were companies like the Yellow Pages, which had essentially taken an old paper directory and put it online. Thumbtack didn’t think this was ultimately the right user experience. And yet, to optimize for SEO at the time, this directory structure was beneficial because it would allow Google to quickly understand their site architecture and rank the relevant pages.</p><p id="abb10816-4b3c-4f21-8d16-ab2468540c33" class="">For example, Thumbtack chose to include links to all 50 states on their homepage, as you can see in the image below.

On-page content</strong></p><p id="1ff6faf7-fcf8-446e-b0d1-6c4b26410f81" class="">To support the new pages, the team needed a massive volume of high quality, unique content. They built a team dedicated to content, which curated user-generated content like reviews and the profile pages of service professionals, and adapted it for the needs of different kinds of pages. At first this was a highly manual effort. At its peak, there were hundreds of people across multiple offices entirely devoted to content curation and generation. However once the company had meaningful engineering resources, they began investing in automation of this process, an initiative that continues today.</p><p id="f98bf4f0-d0ed-4383-a24c-6e51c4da9b00" class=""><strong>3. Linkbuilding</strong></p><p id="da110fe6-0d38-4374-8277-f4147a1a2b0e" class="">In order to get all of these pages to rank, it was important to send a signal to Google that thumbtack.com was reputable. The primary way the team did this was to invest in earning links from many reputable, external sources — often called “backlinks.”</p><p id="52ac948b-443d-40df-9b80-a1f6cdbb525d" class="">To provide a sense for the scale of this effort, one of the most successful initiatives became known as the “Small Business Friendliness Survey.” It involved surveying about 15,000 service professionals each year on how well their local state and city governments supported small businesses. They used this data to create many locally-targeted press releases. In fact in the early days, for each wave, Sander personally wrote 130 individual press releases. These press releases were pitched to a database of every local newspaper, radio station, TV station, chamber of commerce, state and national senator, governor, and mayor — some 30,000 contacts in all.</p><p id="3c6cab6a-50c9-42bf-8d85-b08d80d31f94" class="">All of this work to create high-quality pages that brought in visitors was just one step of the puzzle. Once there was enough traffic, the team began experimenting with increasing conversion rate, ultimately launching hundreds of experiments which in total increased conversion rate by more than 2x. For example, one common area of testing was to add and reorder the questions that customers saw when describing their projects. Because they needed a tool to quickly launch and analyze these experiments, they also built an in-house system that was effectively an Optimizely, Mixpanel, and Mode in one.</p><p id="471b1b8d-6f4f-4761-83af-5eabbc72f7c8" class="">So, what did all of these efforts yield? For the first 3 months, almost nothing. And then a trickle of traffic. At 6 months, there still wasn’t much traffic, but there was at least enough to start analyzing. At 18 months, it became a meaningful share of consumer traffic to the site. At 36 months, it was the primary form of customer acquisition. These lead times are not uncommon, and can cause companies to give up hope on SEO.</p><h3 id="fdab8793-c394-40e9-9c27-eb1358795749" class="">Case Study #2 (continued): How Airbnb committed to Virality</h3><p id="1096bb20-4f5f-4164-b6f6-4b6e19215b10" class="">With a clear mandate to double-down on the referrals program, the Airbnb growth team set out to commit to their first big experiment.

We realized that if we could do this at scale, we could create six million pages to point Google ads to. But this was way before Google Maps, or the iPhone, and geo-coding was hard. For example, we didn’t know the GPS coordinates of hotels. So it was a huge project. We settled on a map interface that allowed individual hotels to select their location on a map, to give us their exact location. This allowed us to show users which listings were close to thetse POIs on our landing pages.”</em></p><p id="077dba2e-4061-4e52-a2d9-c35e07a5ca71" class="">With this MVP built and showing early success, Kosten says the team started to double-down on AdWords:</p><p id="d6468951-f0c4-40d3-9ec4-5023a5250de2" class=""><em>“We first started by constraining the marketplace. We created a bounding box for every location (e.g. “Hotels in Valencia”), and for each location created a landing page with a map of the area, all of the hotels in the area, the POIs, and search box. We constrained by language, translating the pages into many languages, with hundreds of translators on the payroll at one point.

The hallmark of this third stage is overcoming diminishing returns. Virtually every customer acquisition channel becomes harder over time because you are acquiring lower and lower intent customers.

One key area they focused on was the relevance of customer intent. A key limiter in SEO is the number of people performing searches that are relevant to your product. Thumbtack’s initial success came in keywords that indicated a very high intent to hire a pro, but ultimately, they had to expand to lower intent searches because they had saturated the high intent ones. Instead of just targeting customers looking to “hire a landscape”, they expanded to those searching for the “cost of a landscaper” or “landscaping ideas”. To do this, in addition to launching new pages to target these keywords, the team had to develop entirely new approaches to the user experience and content to give customers what they were looking for.</p><p id="54c3604e-03c0-4f07-850c-cf700529d6f8" class="">As the team fought these scaling challenges, they grew the channel to millions of unique visitors per month. But regardless of their efforts to combat diminishing returns, the year-over-year growth rate from SEO began to slow. The team knew they needed to layer on additional approaches to growth.</p><p id="b91447da-91c3-4f40-92a2-087639b4c0a8" class="">Over the years, Thumbtack had increased the value of each new user that signed up by improving customer retention, which allowed them to significantly expand their paid marketing efforts. And even more importantly, they invested in creating a compelling customer experience, which grew repeat and direct traffic, which today represents the largest and fastest growing share of the business. Sander Daniels describes this arc:</p><p id="d67cd34c-f9ce-4150-b6b2-402362ac8ad1" class=""><em>“Success in SEO bought us the time to invest in what we ultimately saw as the most important part of the business, which was to build a delightful product and trustworthy brand that drove repeat use. It was about 4 years in that we reached enough scale that we knew SEO should no longer be the primary lens.</em></p><p id="d79f8a75-f844-4935-9c9f-7797318c7457" class=""><em>We started viewing everything through product and brand.

Operating a startup is a messy business: the future is uncertain and resources are scarce. To help you navigate, here are our answers to some of the most common questions we hear from companies that are trying to put it into practice:</p><h3 id="553dfedd-2b58-41dc-b48b-cab29a0e89bc" class="">Who should be leading these efforts and making key decisions?</h3><p id="3c83398d-00d6-46d8-af6b-65e1628d0895" class="">During the “validate” stage, it’s common for a product manager or marketer to own the process. The decision to commit to a lane is a whole-company decision which ultimately has to be made by the CEO, so this owner’s key job is to tee up the right information to allow the executive team to make well-informed decisions.</p><p id="dc6b01da-dcbf-4467-a33d-7d471be8439c" class="">During the “commit” stage, the effort will quickly become significantly more complex and begin involving multiple teams. However it is still useful to have one person who is ultimately accountable for the success of the initiative and holds all of the moving pieces in their head. This is often a senior marketing or product person.</p><p id="a7316abf-2a9f-4a84-9056-23334c75689f" class="">During the “scale” stage, the original owner may be able to scale with the effort, or it may need to be owned by a more senior person.</p><h3 id="67f32ac9-3b9b-4348-96af-6105e15e0092" class="">I tested a lane and got pretty bad results. How do I know if that means a lane won’t work, or if my approach just wasn’t right?</h3><p id="5dc2aa9c-e164-4e42-a3f4-2ab94b217a0f" class="">This is one of the most difficult questions to answer when it comes to customer acquisition. And while there is no set formula, here are a couple of questions you can ask yourself to determine if you’re on the right path.</p><ul id="09db62fb-80ff-4b78-9697-7f454ae729ee" class="bulleted-list"><li><em>Just how far off the mark are we?</em> If you’re off by an order of magnitude (e.g. payback periods are much too long, or initial keyword research suggests there isn’t enough relevant search volume to make a dent in your business), it’s unlikely that you can simply execute your way to success. But if you’re off by perhaps 2-3x, you’re in shouting distance and may want to do more work to validate.</li></ul><ul id="e1f50c18-c419-4d5b-8bcc-61406b6f921e" class="bulleted-list"><li><em>Have we taken a “real” shot on goal?</em> It’s important to understand whether your testing is a close enough approximation of what your ultimate program might look like. For example, does your ad copy, conversion flow, referral mechanics, and payment flow roughly resemble what you think it might once you commit? If not, it might be worth going back to understand how you can run a more robust test.</li></ul><ul id="27ba8640-1d3d-4bbc-aa1b-1646b70b6c6c" class="bulleted-list"><li><em>Is this lane a natural fit for your business?</em> Revisit the suggestions we shared above to help you gauge whether that lane is ever likely to work for you.</li></ul><h3 id="c4758cd0-0b8f-4898-a76d-0a41f797be1d" class="">How does the timing of each step of the framework line up with fundraising?</h3><p id="e4bdbad4-7f60-4549-bd7d-57bc44968180" class="">No two stories are exactly the same, and you obviously have to do what is right for your business and fundraising needs. But here are some rules of thumb that we commonly observe:</p><ul id="9bb423da-7063-4e55-81bd-565bdb59988b" class="bulleted-list"><li>When raising a series A, it can be very effective to be able to share data from the “validate” stage and your plan for how you will commit to one or more lanes once you have raised.</li></ul><ul id="39c6706b-aab2-472f-b5fe-b3bb7b486f05" class="bulleted-list"><li>By series B-C, most businesses are well into the “scale” phase and seeing meaningful results in at least one lane. This demonstrates that you don’t only have product market fit, but that you have a repeatable customer acquisition engine and business model to support it.</li></ul><ul id="c146c441-98c7-47b3-a229-1e68c6d68d44" class="bulleted-list"><li>Around series C-D, many businesses are starting to see the impacts of diminishing returns from their core acquisition lane. This often means that they need to do one or both of (a) commit to and scale a new lane or (b) expand into meaningful new markets or segments where you can get additional leverage out of your existing customer acquisition lane.</li></ul><blockquote id="c4ab70d1-10da-4906-9725-ca8ad0f784e9" class="">Investors want to know that you know how to turn their money into more money. Demonstrating validation of a scalable customer acquisition lane is one of the most important components of making your case.</blockquote><p id="45d124db-d698-4214-91e4-574ad2a43897" class="">The biggest customer acquisition mistake we see companies make is underestimating the time and effort it takes to make a lane really work, and spreading their efforts too thin as a result.</p><p id="8e024ced-18c9-4fbc-bd42-e4040033b376" class="">It is easy to see why this happens. It’s scary to make the leap into a big investment when resources are limited and speed is of the essence. We hope this framework can help give you the structure needed to evaluate your options methodically and make big, disciplined bets in the right lanes.</p><p id="1d04e692-c373-4408-bfaa-b74d0f889400" class="">And remember, all it takes is one highly successful lane to win the race.</p><p id="2c7d5731-a663-4506-9424-2f6f410afb5c" class=""><em>Huge thank you to Sander Daniels, Arthur Kosten, Gustaf Alströmer, Dan Hill, Brain Balfour, and Casey Winters for their contributions to this post.</em></p><p id="b40c15df-314f-4b71-8433-3ffa5f1fc945" class=""><em>Cover photo Getty Images / Xuanyu Han.</em></p></div></article></body></html>
