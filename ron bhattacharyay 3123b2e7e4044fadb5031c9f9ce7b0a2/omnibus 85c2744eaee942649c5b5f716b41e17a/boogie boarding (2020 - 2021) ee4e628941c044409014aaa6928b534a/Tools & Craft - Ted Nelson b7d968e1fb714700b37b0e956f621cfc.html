I became interested in the future. I thought it was going to be a wonderful future, all chromium and Art Deco with rocket ships. And when I was 13 or 14 in the so-called “golden age of science fiction,” I was avidly reading about how wonderful it was going to be when we had space satellites. My favorite author — amazingly — was L.

As with many subjects before they became popular in college, you realize, hey, I shouldn&#x27;t be worrying about the academic stuff. I can manage my own education, and here&#x27;s an opportunity to do new projects of all kinds.</p><p id="90bf4b71-bc2b-45a7-97df-0d0100ab1215" class="">So I was in theater. I directed a play and got a prize for that. I was an actor. I had my own magazine. Here&#x27;s the third issue of my magazine called Nothing. I&#x27;m terribly proud. So it was kite-shaped and you had to unfold it gradually in peculiar ways. And the illustration, by the way, was by a wonderful guy named Russ Ryan, but I designed the whole thing.</p><p id="2f5ae89a-bf21-4324-9469-4debfb6dfa3f" class="">I laid it out. The printer had no idea what we were doing. I showed him the mock-up, and I thought he understood. But we actually had to staple together the first copy. He had no idea what to do. And now I look at it, and I say, &quot;How in the hell did I plan on that?&quot; I have no idea, but I&#x27;m terribly proud of it still. It&#x27;s elegant, and I was on the student council, and I campaigned for sexual freedom.</p><p id="a4fe7e38-e789-4a97-8c23-fef1d2c35c05" class="">Now, this was a time when women had to sign back into their dorms every night.

I was arguing with the Dean of Students about this on the Student Affairs Committee in my senior year. So then she called up the head of the biology department, and she said, &quot;We&#x27;re going to get Ted Nelson. We&#x27;re going to expel him.&quot;</p><p id="3cc7583b-3d56-4f6b-84a8-fcb5d7c396f9" class="">This was the second semester of my senior year. And Dr. Enders, the head of the biology department said, &quot;No, you&#x27;re not. The faculty will stand behind him.&quot; They were always my audience, because they were very sticky.</p><p id="93b09817-854f-4197-b9f4-753237dfe85b" class="">So the climax of all this was my senior year when I wanted to see if I could make movies. So, my roommate and I got a $700 grant from the student council to make a movie. $700 in those days would buy you one hour of black and white film stock development and a work print. That&#x27;s it. No sound and 16 millimeter, of course. And so I said, okay, I&#x27;ll shoot it silent and then we&#x27;ll put the sound on later. That was called &#x27;wild sound&#x27; in those days. So it was all planned.</p><p id="b53f0fbb-2067-481c-8bb1-5259a4f51971" class="">Tony was going to write it, and I was going to film. And then Tony died. So I said, oh that&#x27;s the end of that. But at the end of that second semester, I thought, &quot;No, wait a minute. Tony would have wanted me to go on.&quot; I made the movie, and I made it up as I went along. So it&#x27;s a half hour comedy about loneliness in college.</p><p id="c3d510cb-5fbe-44a4-b6fb-e8235a533149" class="">I&#x27;m terribly proud of it. I consider myself a good filmmaker. But most people don&#x27;t get it because A) it&#x27;s badly synchronized, B) it&#x27;s in black and white, and C) it&#x27;s a melancholy satire that&#x27;s slow-moving.

And yet, time sharing I think — I was told the maximum number that they could do was seven maybe four users at a time. But they showed all these things on the screen, and Doug was on his microphone from San Francisco directing the whole affair, which was being transmitted via truck up on the highway that could see both Stanford and San Francisco. And the projector they used at the Demo was an Eidophor projector — one of these insane things that had a metal surface covered with oil and an electron beam wrote the picture on this oil, which was then reflected by a bright light through the projector.

This was two years before his Great Demo, and we saw the mouse and word processor and all this wonderful stuff he&#x27;d done. And it was great, and Doug was obviously a wonderful man, and we were very friendly. He kind of half offered me a programming job, but I wanted to do it my way.

So, if you wanted to get a file from the Internet, you had to know its address and know the operating system it was under and the addressing system it was under in order to reach that file. So the URL changed all that, giving every operating system an overlay addressing scheme so that a space became %20. That was how Tim worked out to unify the address space of the Net. That to me is his greatest achievement, and the rest would have followed if he&#x27;d done that.
