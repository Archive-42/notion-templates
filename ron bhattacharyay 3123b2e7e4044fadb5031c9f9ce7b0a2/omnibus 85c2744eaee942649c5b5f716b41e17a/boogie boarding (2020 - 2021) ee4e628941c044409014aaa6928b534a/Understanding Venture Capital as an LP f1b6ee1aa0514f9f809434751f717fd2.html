Investing in startups is very risky, and so investors want to know <strong>the level of risk they are taking on </strong>when investing in a startup. For example, if you invest really early in startup X (i.e. two kids in their college dorm room) you are taking on a lot of risk. Compare that scenario to investing in startup Y that has customers, already has revenue, and has a larger team. Investing in Y still has risk, but it is less risk than investing in X. This difference in risk is why investors have separated investing in startups into three different stages. As a startup grows and increases its customer base, there is less investment risk from the point of view of an investor.</p><p id="761f1259-9ff9-4dc0-9293-e8e85575988f" class=""><strong>Why Venture Capital Matters</strong></p><p id="ed701228-abca-498d-81d5-93d413666dcb" class="">A Stanford <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/how-much-does-venture-capital-drive-us-economy">paper</a> released in 2015 outlined the value of venture capital to the US economy.

Over the past few decades, the category defining companies have been funded by venture capital, such as Airbnb, Google, and Uber. These companies have produced enormous returns for venture capital funds, which is what makes investing in startups attractive.

Bob lives in Silicon Valley. Bob has many friends who have their own startups. Bob believes he can invest in a few of his friends’ startups and make a lot of money. Bob only has $2 million of his own, but to invest in at least 10 startups, he needs $50 million. Where will he get this money? Bob decides to talk to Sam, someone he knows at the New York State Pension (a pension fund gets money from people when they are young, invests it, grows the money, and pays out the money to the people when they are in retirement). The NY State Pension has $5 billion, and they want to invest in startups, but they don’t know how to, so they accept the meeting from Bob.</p><p id="11314f3e-8699-4a6f-baa1-e7b9830df909" class="">Bob tells Sam that he has friends that have startups and that Bob can invest in their startups. Sam from the NY State Pension is excited because the pension fund wants to grow their money by investing <strong>some of their money</strong> in startups but they don’t know how to do so. Sam decides that he can give Bob the $50 million from the pension fund, Bob can invest it in startups, and then hopefully that money will grow overtime. Bob estimates after 10 years he can give $100 million back to the NY State Pension. Sam is ecstatic because he thinks that Bob can double the State Pension’s $50 million.</p><p id="bd103768-5600-4cb4-9be5-db3f474ae2bd" class="">Bob then creates his venture capital company (called the General Partner, or GP, shown by the red box above) and he is the sole owner of this company. However, to take the State Pension’s $50 million, Bob needs to create a <strong>fund, </strong>so bob creates a venture capital fund (blue box) with the help of a lawyer. Once Bob creates this fund, the State Pension wires his fund the $50 million. Now Bob has $50 million to invest in his friends’ startups!</p><p id="af3fcd2d-2408-4f89-b645-2b997e6b5f7e" class="">The above example illustrates effectively how a venture capital structure is formed and who the investors are in a venture capital fund (in the above case, the New York State Pension fund).</p><p id="17e2cd52-5306-4075-8403-80f7072963ec" class=""><strong>Mechanics</strong></p><p id="c66d73b9-98d6-4dd6-9a45-49dc34efa36b" class="">There are a few things to note about venture capital funds from a legal standpoint. Usually, funds have finite lives (unlike mutual funds, for example). Most venture capital funds have a fund life of about 10 years. However, many funds technically exist for longer than 10 years because it can take many years to exit a company and return the capital to investors. Overall, fund life can be separated into four main phases:</p><p id="ef00d910-0d59-458a-9f57-b444209d0b98" class="">Source: AllenLatta.com</p><figure id="a70f4cf2-1c30-4e82-887a-2821cc3c39e4" class="image"><a href="Understanding%20Venture%20Capital%20as%20an%20LP%20f1b6ee1aa0514f9f809434751f717fd2/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2F98be32c0-e033-4681-a218-b52c3d799b73_1111x232.jpeg"><img style="width:700px" src="Understanding%20Venture%20Capital%20as%20an%20LP%20f1b6ee1aa0514f9f809434751f717fd2/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2F98be32c0-e033-4681-a218-b52c3d799b73_1111x232.jpeg"/></a></figure><p id="33daa52c-d40c-499a-9ab2-1f2bf8fc34f3" class=""><em>Formation</em>: In this stage, the partners of the GP (in the above case, this would be Bob) set up the actual fund, do all the paper work, find Limited Partners (in the above case, this would be the New York State Pension), and actually get the dollars from the Limited Partners (LPs).</p><p id="fc068e15-df9c-452d-becd-ce9cae9ed0df" class=""><em>Investment: </em>Once all the legal work is done, and the GP actually has the money from the Limited Partners, it is ready to invest in companies.

This fee is usually used to fund expenses such as salaries (people who need to go out, find companies, hire lawyers to sign the paper work to invest in the companies, etc.) and other back office functions like accounting. This fee is called the management fee. It is usually 2% of the total fund assets.</p><p id="4b5f83d3-abec-4b5a-92dc-d7246652cde1" class=""><em>Carried Interest</em></p><p id="e7110575-6c67-4544-b427-ddc05be58075" class="">The second type of fee that GPs receive is called the “carried interest” or “carry.” This type of fee aligns the incentives of the LP (the institutions providing the money in anticipation of return) and the GP (fund managers who want to use their expertise in investing to make money).

A simplified example is provided below:</p><p id="044a0cb3-07e0-4c8a-87b7-118207b1500b" class="">Example: A venture capital fund (Fund XYZ) has $100m in its fund contributed by LPs. It invests in company A for $20m. 7 years later, Fund XYZ sells its investment in Company A for $100m. This is a 5x return. First, Fund XYZ usually returns the invested amount to the LP at no charge (this would be $20m in this case). Any amount above the $20m is profit, which is $80m in this case. Of this $80m, a pre-set percentage is rewarded to the fund managers (this % is set in the formation stage of the fund life cycle). Usually, this is 20%, so in this case the fund managers would get 20% x $80m which is $16m and the LPs would get the other $64m.

This is the $100m that the company was sold for divided by the initial investment in the company ($20m). However, the LP doesn’t actually get a 5x return because it has to pay 20% of the profit to the GP (deservingly so, since the GP found the company and did all the work to invest in it). So the “Net” return is after the LP has paid the GP carry, which is the actual return, in this case 4.2x.

There are a variety of definitions, and many <a href="https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html">VCs have written about this in the past</a> but it is really: <strong>does the product provide significant value to a subset of the population (</strong>customers segment) <strong>and can the company communicate that value to the potential customers?</strong></p><p id="46683861-3ae3-4f81-b070-be215e123a97" class="">In other words, it’s about product and distribution. However, you can only build a product/distribution if you have the team with the right skillset, passion, and experience. So the main factors seem to be:</p><p id="b8871d95-a4ad-4aaf-8f9c-b90716d5a08e" class="">1) How strong is the founder/team for the type of business they want to create. This influences what is in the founder’s control: product and distribution.</p><p id="a091dbe7-8162-46a4-9dc2-34ab69d98294" class="">2) The market the founder is trying to go after.</p><p id="44e95c22-351d-46df-8d03-9b2b94ce4a21" class="">3) Whether the founder can provide enough value to the customers in the target segment (product-market fit).</p><p id="7dba1ea8-0661-4a7b-8204-ef2b967ca9e5" class="">As a venture capital investor, it’s important to be able to assess product-market fit, and be able to invest in the best founders building category-defining companies. To put it simply, it’s about <strong>1) having the network to be able to invest in the best founders</strong>, and <strong>2) assess which “areas” are worth going after</strong>.</p><p id="e5a9df12-e86b-4811-8143-a4eb9e37cb3c" class="">Not all venture capital investors had access to SpaceX’s early funding round. Only the ones that had personal relationships with Elon Musk or truly believed in his vision were able to win the deal and invest in the company.</p><p id="326309ad-3c0c-4b9e-b1cc-03afe8c2e506" class="">The third variable is whether the venture fund is able to “pull-the-trigger” on the highest conviction investments. This is because continuing to back a successful company to maintain ownership % (avoiding dilution, as discussed above) is not easy for most venture investors because it results in some form of concentration, the antithesis of conventional venture investing (many bets, few wins). For example, in the model investment below, a fund below invested in Company XYZ at a valuation of $10m and received 10% ownership. This company ends up being a home-run, with its valuation going up 100x, but the fund’s ownership gets diluted from 10% to 2%, dampening its return to a 20x, which is still a homerun but may not be enough if the fund is extremely diversified. The venture fund could have done a better job in making sure it was a significant investor in later rounds. This would have resulted in a higher overall return for the fund. However, this requires 1) preferential access since the founder of the startup should continue to want the venture capital firm to be an investor, and 2) conviction from the venture capital fund to size up the position.</p><figure id="695191e1-78a2-4b04-b591-18b45b2d7399" class="image"><a href="Understanding%20Venture%20Capital%20as%20an%20LP%20f1b6ee1aa0514f9f809434751f717fd2/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2F23dbabb2-b55f-4baa-bd1c-1b8e98a5aa16_741x195.png"><img style="width:700px" src="Understanding%20Venture%20Capital%20as%20an%20LP%20f1b6ee1aa0514f9f809434751f717fd2/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2F23dbabb2-b55f-4baa-bd1c-1b8e98a5aa16_741x195.png"/></a></figure><p id="58432ffa-2a06-4406-98af-c919ce7ca9a0" class="">A paper published in the <em>Journal of Financial Economics</em> titled, “The Persistence Effect of Initial Success: Evidence from Venture Capital” noted:</p><blockquote id="218dce43-d32d-4198-9ef6-abc76bba8e65" class="">“We find that initial success appears to depend in large part on being in the right places at the right times. VC firms, however, do not appear to have any ability to select those attractive segments on a consistent basis. Differences in the selection or nurturing of specific portfolio companies also appear to contribute little to explaining persistence. Overall, our results appear most consistent with performance persistence in venture capital arising from differential access to deal flow for VCs whose initial investments were more successful.”</blockquote><p id="d5314fe3-7651-4e12-b12d-bfaf91f526f2" class="">Firstly, it’s important to point out that <strong>initial success matters in venture capital</strong>. This is not intuitive, because initial success in public market funds does not predict future returns (correlation of close to 0). In venture capital, on the other hand, the correlation between future fund performance and historical fund performance can be as high as 0.7. <a href="https://aanandbajaj.substack.com/p/understanding-venture-capital-as">1</a></p><p id="b6adf958-06bb-4b21-ae56-1cb236ece99f" class="">There are two key implications from the above analysis:</p><p id="5916eb81-76c6-44bc-906d-9054a34d251e" class="">1) What matters the most in venture capital is deal flow, or the ability to invest in the best companies</p><p id="15b957dd-f8a8-4768-b410-2bdcc9fdc67a" class="">2) Success begets success because initial success results in preferential access going forward.</p><p id="2dfb9613-dd1e-49c3-835b-7d6c30d9dc9e" class="">Yet again, a further question arises: <strong>what predicts initial success?</strong></p><p id="c311d0dd-6d04-40ee-ae77-a1bdb05d31ac" class="">Using data analysis, the paper mentioned prior concludes that initial success is based “almost entirely” on investing in the right segment at the right time, either by chance or by the ability to anticipate emerging trends. Interestingly, the paper also noted that VCs that invested in attractive segments in the past had no consistent ability to do this going forward.</p><p id="4dcde096-3e16-4c42-a572-aa1f254289c3" class="">Going even deeper, the outperformance and performance persistence seems to lie not only with specific venture funds, but also with specific individual <strong>partners</strong>. A paper published in <em>The Journal of The American Finance Association</em> noted<a href="https://aanandbajaj.substack.com/p/understanding-venture-capital-as">2</a>:</p><blockquote id="a1956c3b-cc4d-484e-b072-a0836d209711" class="">“We find evidence of skill and exit style differences even among venture partners investing at the same VC firm at the same time. Furthermore, our estimates suggest the partners&#x27; human capital is two to five times more important than the VC firm&#x27;s organizational capital in explaining performance.”</blockquote><p id="84e41fe7-48e2-48bd-9d0c-6e3ef66677be" class="">This may also explain why emerging managers have been producing a greater share of the returns over the past few years, since partners regularly leave a venture capital firm that they were successful in to start their own fund.</p><p id="61ba00f4-ff17-40d9-ad02-7b37398805c0" class="">The last point to note is that there is strong evidence of mean reversion of returns for VC funds who have had strong performance and performance persistence overtime. Several papers, such as Harris et al (2014) and Nanda et al (2019) have concluded this. This could be due to the following reasons:</p><ul id="f61b4bbc-f830-475f-9b5a-14f5bf78c04d" class="bulleted-list"><li>Size: Initial success begets further success, which attracts further investors and an attractiveness to larger funds (more fees for the GP)</li></ul><ul id="4c96b2c1-daf2-4984-8caf-5bfa0b3715e6" class="bulleted-list"><li>Partner Attrition: As we saw, most of the venture capital fund outperformance can be attributed to specific partners within a fund, and sometimes partners leave and start their own fund.</li></ul><p id="ae93af82-f0fb-4915-b8f1-b4202735784b" class="">The point on size is also supported by evidence. As the Kauffman Foundation notes, “we have no funds in our portfolio that have raised more than $500m and returned more than 2x our capital after fees.” This makes sense because the larger the fund, the larger the check sizes, and the larger the companies need to exit at to deliver a 3x return. For example, for a company valued at $10m to return a 50x, it needs to get to a valuation of $500m. On the other hand, for a $500m valuation company to deliver a 50x, it needs to get to a valuation of $25 <strong>billion.</strong> Larger companies attract more competition, and more competition dampens profits and therefore puts an upper cap at the size of company size.</p><h3 id="7749548f-47fb-42a2-91bf-7603a7b362ad" class="">How Can LPs Stack the Odds in Their Favor?</h3><p id="be871a34-3e97-4fb1-be3d-4317d3bcdd5a" class="">Now that we have established what matters in venture capital (to deliver outperformance), how can LPs who want to build a venture program actually execute and stack the odds in their favor?</p><p id="efab71ed-6749-4de0-acfd-0e05d488a49c" class="">First, it would be summarize everything mentioned above to evaluate all the different “flavors” in venture capital fund investing from an LP’s perspective.</p><p id="d95de92a-4786-4580-a408-e59ecb9cb186" class=""><strong>Different Types of Funds to Invest in and Their Characteristics</strong></p><p id="6b1bf06a-d3db-49ae-837e-0ebaa683b963" class="">The rows:</p><ul id="d00f7749-b74c-4a84-89f6-cc9a7a4b9bdd" class="bulleted-list"><li>Emerging Partner: a partner who does not have past success in venture capital (i.e. first-time venture partners).
